<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO THE FIRST<br>
GERMAN EDITION</h2>

</div>

<p>In older works on liturgy, the festivals of the Church
have been generally dealt with as forming part of a
greater whole, while in more recent times various
questions relating to them have been discussed in
separate articles in encyclopædias and reviews. The
time seems now to have come when the cycle of
ecclesiastical festivals ought to be regarded as a definite
department of study by itself. The older works, besides
being difficult of access, do not come up to the standard
of modern works on the same subject, and the independent
investigations of recent date, although throwing
much new light upon some points, have left others untouched,
with the result that the reader is unable to gain
a clear conception of the matter as a whole.</p>

<p>The solid results gained by investigations into this
branch of study in earlier and later times must now be
collected, and systematised, and brought up to the
level demanded by modern science. Much remains
to be done in this department owing to the fresh light
that has been thrown upon it by the publication of
documents hitherto inaccessible, among which we may
mention the so-called Peregrinatio Silviæ discovered
by Gamurrini, the Lectionaries of Silos, and the critical
edition of the so-called Martyrologium Hieronymianum
of de Rossi and Duchesne. The last-named document
has so far been more of a hindrance than a help in this
branch of study, some attributing too much importance
to it, and others none at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span></p>

<p>It has seemed to the author that the time for gathering
together the ascertained results derived from these
and similar books has come. It is chiefly for theological
students and the younger clergy that the following
book is intended. Such a work as would make it easy
to deal with the subject in sermons and catechetical
instructions, and, at the same time, would give clearly
and briefly all the information necessary for dealing
with the question from the historical standpoint, avoiding
equally uncritical credulity and sceptical unbelief—such
a work seems to the author demanded by the
circumstances of the time.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Minister of Public Worship in Prussia
has recently (12th Sept. 1898) required from candidates
for the office of catholic teacher in higher grade schools,
a considerable acquaintance with the ecclesiastical year
among their other qualifications.</p>

<p>This is the reason why the author has confined his
attention solely to the worship of the Roman Catholic
Church, merely alluding occasionally to the usages of
other religious bodies. For the same reason, in accordance
with the meaning of the term “Heortology,” he has
concerned himself with those festivals alone which are
publicly celebrated, or were so celebrated formerly.
The majority of these afford no features of historical
interest, owing, as they do, their origin to the action of
authority. In cases which do not here come under discussion,
reference may be made to separate works and
to the Bollandists in general. In a matter of such
practical interest as this, it cannot fail that some points
have been omitted; still, I think, the amount of material
collected in the following pages is sufficient for the end I
have had in view. In support of the views herein expressed,
a somewhat detailed account is given in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
third part of the documents which serve as the sources
of our information. It has not seemed practical to
print a selection from the large number of these
documents by way of supplement, since to have done so
would have interfered with the object of this book.</p>

GERMAN EDITION</h2>

</div>

<p>This second (revised and enlarged) edition—from which
Dr A. Mercati, Professor in the Seminary of Reggio,
Emilia, has made the Italian translation—is in substance
the same as the first. The sections dealing with the
dedication of churches and the feast of the patron
saint, with the feast of the Immaculate Conception,
with the feasts of St Mary Magdalen, St Cecilia, and
St Catherine, and the two concluding sections have
been added, and some appendices.</p>

<p>In this translation, the excursus on the German
Protestant “Buss-und-Bettage” and on St Ursula
have been omitted as being of less general interest,
and a few notes have been added.</p>

<h1>HEORTOLOGY</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PART_I">PART I<br>
<span class="smaller">THE CHURCH’S FESTIVALS IN GENERAL</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>1. <i>Introduction</i></h3>

<p>The external worship of God, if it is not to remain
vague and indefinite, finds expression on the one hand
through certain elements belonging to the senses, such
as signs and words, and on the other it is connected with
places and times. By the changes of day and night,
of seasons and years, Creation calls upon man to raise
his mind to God at stated times and to enter into communion
with Him. The day with its brightness is
suited for work, night with its stillness invites man to
turn his thoughts in upon himself. The change of day
and night calls upon us to begin the day’s work with God,
and to commend ourselves to His keeping in the darkness
of the night. The course of the seasons, too,
matures the fruits of the earth necessary for our support,
and the succession of years reminds us of the fleeting
nature of everything earthly, for our whole life is composed
of successive years. Consequently the civilised
peoples already in remote antiquity have found a call
to the worship of God in the changing seasons and times,
and so have introduced sacred seasons. Sacred times
and places are common to all religions in general. The
change of times, bringing with them corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
changes in nature, made a religious impression upon
mankind. In turn, man sanctified certain times and
dedicated them to God, and these days thus consecrated
to God became festivals.</p>

<p>The worship of God takes precedence over the daily
affairs of common life, and accordingly displaces such of
them as are not necessary for the support of natural
life or the wellbeing of society. Thus it came to pass
that the ordinary affairs of life gave place to the worship
of God, and rest from labour became an essential part
of the worship paid to Him. Man abstained from his
wonted tasks on certain days, which received in consequence
a higher consecration. And so among the
ancient Romans, the idea of a day of rest and a holy day
were intimately connected and received the name of
<i>feria</i>. But it was among the Hebrews that the days set
apart for the worship of God received the most distinctive
character as days of rest.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Christian Church on her part, in wishing that the
day set apart for the worship of God should be observed
as far as possible as a day of rest from labour, acts in
accordance with ideas and customs which nature itself
has planted in the human race, and which need no other
justification. The term <i>sabbatismus</i> (Sabbath rest)
soon entered into the theological language of Christendom,
and in public life the Christian holy days, at
first only Sundays, gradually, even in secular legislation,
became recognised as days of rest, sometimes in a larger
and sometimes in a smaller number.</p>

<p>The entire number of ecclesiastical holy days and
seasons is actually codified for us in the different Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Calendars. Their contents fall into two essentially
different divisions, each possessing an entirely different
origin and history. The first division consists of
festivals of our Lord, distributed over the year, regulated
and co-ordinated in accordance with certain laws. The
second division consists of commemorations of the
saints in no wise connected with the festivals of our Lord
or with one another. Occupying to some extent an
intermediate position between these two chief divisions
come the festivals of our Blessed Lady, which have this
in common with the festivals of the saints, that they
fall on fixed days, but, on the other hand, they are to a
certain extent connected with each other, and with some
feasts of our Lord. This is carried out in such a way
that they are distributed throughout the entire Church’s
year, and are included in each of the festal seasons.</p>

<p>The former of these two divisions is the most important,
and its chief feasts are also the oldest. The festivals
of our Lord, Easter and Pentecost especially, compose
what is called the Church’s year in the stricter sense,
and, if they coincide with a saint’s day, they take precedence.
The Church’s year is built upon a single basis
and according to one plan, which did not originate in the
mind of any one person, but developed out of the historical
conditions resulting from the connection of
Christianity with Judaism.</p>

<p>In the course of the ecclesiastical year, the Church
brings before us the chief events in our Lord’s life and
the most striking instances of His work of redemption.
The central point of the whole is the commemoration of
His death and resurrection—<i>i.e.</i> Easter—to which all
other events are related, whether those which reach backward
to Christmas, or those which reach onwards to the
completion of His redemptive work at Whitsuntide.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
In addition, there is, on the one hand, Advent, as a time
of preparation for our Lord’s coming, reminding us of
the four or five thousand years which intervened
between the Creation and that event, and, on the other,
the Sundays after Pentecost, representing the period
after the foundation of the Church, and devoted to the
consideration of the redemption won for us, along with
its doctrines and blessings. The weeks of the year
form the links of the chain, each Sunday marking the
character of the week which follows it.</p>

<p>The sacred seasons, as they pass in orderly succession,
give outward expression to the spirit which animates
the Church, and are of the utmost importance from the
point of view of her worship, since they form one of the
chief elements in the instruction of mankind in the
truths of Christianity. By them one easily becomes
familiar with Christianity itself.</p>

<p>Every religion has its festivals, but none has so rich
and so carefully thought out a system of feasts as the
Catholic Church. If we may compare it to some
artistically constructed edifice, we can regard the festivals
of our Lord as forming the piers which support
all the rest, the lesser feasts as contributing the decorations,
and the Sundays, with their attendant weeks,
as the stones of which the walls are built. Naturally all
this did not exist at first, but, like many other things in
the Church, has grown up into its present proportions
from small beginnings.</p>

<p>We are not told that the Divine Founder of the Church
appointed a single festival or left behind Him any
instructions on the matter; still the germ, destined by
Providence to develop afterwards into the system of
festivals with which we are familiar, existed from the
beginning. The subsequent rich and varied development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
of this system was not the work of individuals, but
was due to the working of the spirit which ever rules
the Universal Church, and ever renews itself within her.
Love towards the Redeemer and gratitude for what He
has done for us called the round of Christian festivals
into being. The authorities in the Church have played
the part of the gardener, pruning away superfluous shoots
and branches. In view of the numerous institutions of
this kind, some of which date back to remote antiquity,
it was not a mere figure of speech which Tertullian
made use of when, referring to the numerous heathen
festivals, he addressed the Christians of his time with
the words, “You have your own ‘<i>fasti</i>’” (“<i>Habes tuos
fastos.</i>”—<i>De Corona</i>, c. 13).</p>

<p>The outline of the ecclesiastical year was prefigured
in the Old Law, while the synagogue furnished the
fundamental elements in its festivals, the Sabbath in
particular, and in the division of the year into weeks.
This renders a glance at the religious year of the Jews
necessary, for, apart from it, it is impossible to understand
the essential character of the Christian year.</p>

<p>The Jewish festivals in the time of Christ were instituted
either in commemoration of events connected
with the divine covenant, such as the Passover, or they
were of an agrarian character or commemorated some
national event, as the dedication of the Temple, Purim,
Jom Kippar, etc.</p>

<p>According to the dates of their origin they fall into
two classes:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The ancient festivals instituted by Moses: the
Passover, the Feast of Weeks, in the earlier part of the
year; the Feast of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and
the Feast of Tabernacles, in autumn, <i>i.e.</i> on the first,
seventh, and fifteenth days of the month Tizri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The more recent festivals instituted by the
Synagogue, such as the Dedication of the Temple on the
25th Chisleu; Purim, or the Feast of Haman, on the
14th Adar. To these were added four fast days as
days of national humiliation.</p>

<p>Consequently, since the death of Christ took place
on the first day of the feast of the Passover (15th Nisan),
and since the Descent of the Holy Ghost followed on the
day of Pentecost, the chief Jewish feasts served as the
foundation of the Christian ecclesiastical year, and the
Apostles could join with the Jews in their Passover
celebration. Certainly the object of their feast was
very different from that of the Jews, yet, outwardly
there was no separation from the synagogue.</p>

<h3>2. <i>Sunday and its Observance as a Day of Rest</i></h3>

<p>The Sabbath and the week of seven days, by their
appointment in the ancient Law, formed already a
necessary element of the ecclesiastical year and maintained
their position in the Church. The division of the
year into weeks is not specifically Jewish, but rather
Semitic, since we find it in existence in ancient Babylon,
though there a new week began with the first day of every
month, and the first, seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first,
and twenty-eighth days of the month were always days of
rest.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This system of dividing time into weeks received
a religious consecration among the Jews, inasmuch as
the Sabbath rest was enjoined by the Law under the
severest sanctions. All servile work of whatsoever
kind must be laid aside on the Sabbath, according to the
Jewish law. It was not even permitted to light a fire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
or prepare food. Important as was the place given to
rest, it was, however, only one part, and that a subordinate
part of the Sabbath festival. The most
important part was the performance of the acts of
divine worship God enjoined upon the people, that is to
say the sacrifice of a holocaust, consisting of two yearling
lambs, along with “flour tempered with oil and the
libations.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>There is no evidence of the Sabbath having been
abrogated by Christ or the Apostles, but St Paul
declared its observance was not binding on Gentile
converts, who soon formed the majority of those converted
to the faith; and in Col. ii. 16, he classes it along
with the feasts of the new moon. Accordingly, the
observance of the Sabbath fell more and more into the
background, yet not without leaving some traces
behind.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It appears at first to have rather existed side
by side with Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Among the Christians, the first
day of the Jewish week, the <i>prima sabbati</i>, the present
Sunday, was held in honour as the day of our Lord’s
resurrection and was called the Lord’s Day.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This name
took the place of the name <i>dies solis</i>, formerly in use
among the Greeks and Romans. The different days of
the week were named after the heavenly bodies, which
in turn took their names from the chief divinities of
heathen mythology. Thus the names <i>dies solis</i>, <i>lunæ</i>,
<i>Martis</i>, etc., were very general and widespread in
antiquity. The Christians did not employ these titles
for liturgical purposes, but called the week-days simply
<i>feriæ</i>, and distinguished them merely by numbers.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the romance languages the ecclesiastical name for Sunday,
<i>dies dominica</i>, has quite taken the place of all others.</p>

<p>These names were already in use in the Apostolic
period, and Sunday was the day on which the eucharistic
worship of God was performed.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Christian worship
in the earliest time consisted of two parts. Already,
in the letters of Pliny, we find mention of a nocturnal
service of preparation at which psalms were sung,
prayers recited, and passages read from Holy Scripture.
The eucharistic part of the service followed at dawn.
These two parts appear sharply distinguished, especially
in the diary of Silvia (or Etheria). The vigil service
developed out of the first part. The second part in
Silvia’s diary usually bears the name of <i>Oblatio</i>, while
the term <i>missa</i> denotes merely the dismissal of the faithful
and the respective divisions of the psalmody.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> There
also seems to have been a general confession of sins at
the commencement of the service, which explains the
exhortation of the “Teaching of the Apostles,” that the
faithful should confess their sins on Sunday. At any
rate, Eusebius plainly refers to the practice, and adds,
“We, the adherents of the New Covenant, are constantly
nourished by the Body of Christ; we continually partake
of the Blood of the Lamb, and celebrate every week on
Sunday the mysteries of the true Lamb, by Whom we
have been redeemed.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Upon the cessation of persecution,
the present arrangement of divine service soon
became established—that is to say, Mass and Sermon
at nine <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, with Vespers and Compline as popular
devotions in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>Besides Sunday, at least in Tertullian’s time, the
liturgy was performed on Wednesday and Friday, the
so-called Station Days. In the East, on the other hand,
it was performed only on Saturdays, at least in many
places.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> To put on one’s best clothes for attendance at
worship was a custom of the heathen, which the Christians
retained, and which has survived to the present
day.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>As to the grounds for celebrating Sunday, the Fathers
are unanimous from the earliest times—it was kept as a
festival because Christ rose again on the first day of the
Jewish week.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> A clear indication of this is given by
the practice observed in Jerusalem in the fourth century
of reading at the psalmody on each of the Sundays in
Quinquagesima, the Gospel of the resurrection of
Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The first Christian Emperor did his best to promote
the observance of Sunday and to show it all respect as a
day of prayer. He gave leave to the Christian soldiers
of his army to be absent from duty in order that they
might attend divine service. The heathen soldiers,
however, had to assemble in camp without their arms,
and offer up a prayer for the Emperor and his family.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Eusebius, in his “Life of Constantine,” mentions in
detail these pious endeavours of the Emperor, yet his
information must have been incomplete, since Sozomen<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
informs us that Constantine also forbade the law-courts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
to sit on Sunday. It has been attempted to throw
doubt on the veracity of this information because of the
silence of Eusebius; but Sozomen was an advocate, and
must have been better up in the existing legislation
than Eusebius, and, moreover, a clear grasp of the point
at issue along with a lucid representation of all the
facts concerned is not one of the excellences of Eusebius.
The information given by Sozomen is further supported
by the fact that a law of Constantine’s directed to the
same end is in existence.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The prohibition of the transaction of legal business on
Sunday was frequently renewed by his successors, and
extended so as to suspend the courts of arbitration, and
to prohibit summonses for debt.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>A law of Valentinian II., in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 425, forbade games
in the Circus, and all theatrical representations on
Sunday. To the honour of the Emperors it must be
said that they suppressed these representations more
than once.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The Emperor Leo also renewed the law
concerning the Sunday rest, and went so far as to forbid
music on Sundays,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but his law is not included in the
general collection of statutes, having been repealed after
a short time.</p>

<p>As regards working on Sunday, the Church very carefully
avoided the adoption of a pharisaical observance
of the day; but, from the beginning, there was a consensus
of Christian opinion against the continuance of
all work which rendered the attendance of the faithful
at divine worship impossible—as, for instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
labours of slaves or the work of servants. In course
of time this was extended so as to exclude all kinds
of work out of keeping with the dignity of the day.
As to details, different views prevailed to a great
extent in different places and times.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The first
Christian Emperor had already, according to
Eusebius,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> made a law prescribing throughout his
Empire rest on Sundays, and even on Fridays as well.
Ecclesiastical legislation on its part maintained that
slaves must have sufficient free time to attend divine
worship and receive religious instruction in church.
Attendance at this was regarded as the duty of all
grown up Christians.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> For the rest, the prohibition
of work on Sunday was not always regarded in antiquity
as of general obligation. Thus, for example, the Council
of Laodicea forbade Christians on the one hand to
celebrate Saturday in the Jewish manner, and, on the
other, enjoined rest from labour only “in so far as it was
possible.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>That the establishment of rest from labour had special
reference to slaves is shown by the so-called Apostolic
Constitutions. In them we have (8, 33) the days on
which slaves were to be free from labour once more
enumerated in detail, and the limits of the earlier
legislation considerably extended.</p>

<p>Days of rest for slaves were to be: Saturday and
Sunday, Holy Week and Easter Week, the Ascension,
Whitsunday, Christmas, Epiphany, all festivals of
Apostles, St Stephen’s Day, and the feasts of certain
martyrs. Naturally the object of this ordinance was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
not to make all these days festivals in the strict sense
of the word.</p>

<p>In his anxiety to do honour to the holy days of the
Church, the first Christian Emperor went still further.
He desired to make Friday, the day of Christ’s death,
a day of rest and devotion as well.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> We have no information
as to how far this regulation took practical
effect during his life. No trace of such a custom exists
at a later date except among the Nestorians. How
earnest he was in securing the execution of these decrees
is shown by the fact that he commanded the prefects
of the provinces not only to observe Sundays, but
also to celebrate the commemorations of the martyrs,
within their jurisdictions.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It has been already observed that Saturday as well as
Sunday had its liturgical observance. In certain
Eastern countries it attained to a position almost equal
to that of Sunday. For, in the Apostolic Constitutions,
it is laid down that the faithful shall attend divine
service on this day also, and abstain from servile work,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
although the rank of Sunday was acknowledged to be
higher.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The Council of Laodicea forbade indeed, as we
have observed above, the abandonment of work on
Saturday, but it enjoined the reading of the Gospel as
on Sunday (Can. 16). Traces of this pre-eminence of
Saturday among the week-days exists at the present
time in the Churches of the East.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, it is to be noticed that, in the Middle
Ages, the rest from labour commenced, contrary to our
present custom, with the Vespers of Saturday. Pope
Alexander III., however, decreed that local custom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
should retain its prescriptive right, and so it came to
pass that the practice of reckoning the feast day from
midnight to midnight became general.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<h3>3. <i>The Classification of Festivals</i></h3>

<p>According to the points of view taken, festivals may
be divided into different classes:—</p>

<p>1. According to the object of the festival, into
festivals of our Lord and festivals of the saints.</p>

<p>The former fall into three divisions: (<i>a</i>) movable
feasts—Easter, Pentecost, etc.; (<i>b</i>) immovable feasts—Christmas,
Epiphany, etc.; (<i>c</i>) such as are not included
in the above cycles and are immovable, <i>e.g.</i>, the
Transfiguration, Invention of the Cross, etc.</p>

<p>The saints whose feasts are celebrated are either Old
Testament personages—although these do not appear
in the Roman Calendar as they do in others, especially
those of the Oriental Churches—or Apostles, martyrs,
virgins, confessors, angels, and, finally, the Mother of
our Lord.</p>

<p>2. With regard to their observance, festivals may be
either local or general.</p>

<p>3. According to their character, we may theoretically
divide the festivals into commemorative and devotional
festivals. Commemorative festivals are those which
celebrate a historical event, <i>e.g.</i>, the birth, and death
of Jesus, the death of an Apostle, of a martyr, etc.
These, in many cases, are celebrated on the actual day
of the event commemorated. As devotional festivals,
we may rank those which celebrate some mystery of the
Faith, <i>e.g.</i>, the Holy Trinity, or those which, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
they commemorate a particular event, such as the
Transfiguration, do not celebrate it on the day on which
it actually happened.</p>

<p>Since the number of festivals altered much in the
course of centuries, and their objects are so various, they
are distinguished from one another by differences of
rank and a whole series of gradations has arisen.</p>

<p>In the first place there are purely ecclesiastical
festivals whose celebration is confined within the four
walls of the Church (<i>festa chori</i>), and festivals which have
their bearing upon the common life of the people, chiefly
on account of the rest from labour which is conjoined
with them (<i>festa fori</i>).</p>

<p>The so-called <i>feriæ</i> and the festivals strictly so called
are clearly distinguished from one another. According
to the practice of the Church, the ordinary days of the
year have their place in the liturgy, and share to a
certain extent in the festal character of the season,
although distinguished from those days on which is
commemorated some mystery of our redemption or the
memory of a saint. These latter are holy days (<i>festa</i>) in
a higher sense.</p>

<p>These holy days again are divided into greater or
lesser feasts—in the language of the rubrics, into <i>festa
duplicia</i> and <i>simplicia</i>, with an intermediate class, the
<i>semi-duplicia</i>. This is more marked in the arrangements of
the Breviary than in the Missal. This does not exhaust
the differences between festivals, for there are further
distinctions in their rank, especially in the case of the
festivals of our Lord and of the chief mysteries of our
redemption, <i>i.e.</i> <i>duplicia majora</i>, and <i>duplicia primæ</i>
and <i>secundæ classis</i>. The <i>festa duplicia primæ classis</i>
are usually kept up for eight days—the so-called octave;
so too some of the <i>secundæ classis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>The different rank of feasts is not so elaborate among
the Greeks and Russians, for they divide their festivals
simply into greater, intermediate, and lesser, which are
marked in their Calendars by special signs.</p>

<p>The octave which belongs to the chief festivals has its
origin in Judaism, for the Jews prolonged for eight days
the festivals which commemorated the two chief religious
and political events in their history—the Exodus
from Egypt or the Passover, and the Dedication of the
Temple.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> With regard to the Passover, there was
another reason for prolonging the feast during eight
days. Since many Jews, after the Exile, remained
scattered throughout various countries, there was a
risk, owing to the uncertain character of the Jewish
Calendar, that the correct date of the feast might not be
known to all. In order to avoid the misfortune of
celebrating the feast on a wrong day, the feast was
prolonged for eight days, one of which would certainly
be the right day. The first, second, seventh, and last
days were especially regarded as festivals.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Then
Pentecost and Christmas were also observed with an
octave, and so matters remained for a long period. It
was owing to the influence which the Franciscan Order
exerted in liturgical affairs that the number of octaves
was increased. The Franciscans provided an inordinate
number of festivals with octaves in their Breviary, and
observed each day of the octave with the rite of a
<i>festum duplex</i>. In this way a number of saints’ festivals,
in addition to the feasts of our Lord, were provided with
octaves. According to the ancient Roman rite, the
observance of the octave consisted merely in a simple
commemoration of the festival inserted in the office on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the eighth day, without taking any notice of the festival
on the intervening six days.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> A single example of this
ancient custom still exists in the Breviary in the <i>festum
S. Agnetis secundo</i>.</p>

<p>Formerly saints’ festivals were not distinguished from
one another in rank, but all were kept with the rite of a
<i>festum simplex</i>, as it is now called, and also were provided
with one lection only, as the Breviary developed. An
alteration in this respect was introduced by Gregory VII.,
who appointed that the commemoration of Popes who
were also martyrs should be celebrated as <i>festa duplicia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Next, Boniface VIII., in 1298, ordered that the feasts
of the Apostles, Evangelists, and four great doctors of the
Western Church should be advanced to the same rank.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
The Franciscans brought about a complete revolution
by celebrating in their Breviary and in their churches all
festivals of the saints as <i>duplicia</i>, and by adding a number
of new saints.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Pius V. reduced the rank of many
feasts, but over and above the <i>duplicia</i> he permitted
doubles of the first and second class. To the ordinary
<i>duplex</i>, or <i>duplex simpliciter per annum</i>, Clement
VIII. added yet another species, the <i>duplex majus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Thus, according to the present regulations, feasts are
ranked either as <i>simplex</i>, <i>semiduplex</i>, <i>duplex</i>, <i>majus</i>,
<i>duplex II.</i> and <i>I. classis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<h3>4. <i>The Gradual Increase of Festivals. Their Decrease
in the Last Three Centuries. The Present Position</i></h3>

<p>It is a recognised fact in history that the festivals of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the Church in the course of centuries considerably
increased in number, and that, when this increase had
reached its highest point, their number began again to
diminish. This was partly effected by means of legislation
and without disturbance, but partly by the violent
proceedings attendant upon the French Revolution.
The stages in this process will be best understood from
an account of the secular and ecclesiastical legislation
by which they were brought about.</p>

<p>Tertullian<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> is the first ecclesiastical writer who
enumerates the feasts celebrated among the Christians.
The only festivals known to him, and to Origen after him,
are Easter and Pentecost.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> His statement is all the more
noteworthy, because the exigencies of his controversy
with Celsus required he should specify all the festivals by
name. These are, besides Sundays, the Parasceve,
Easter, and Pentecost. Tertullian and Origen are
witnesses respectively for the East and West, and since
their evidence coincides, it is certain that in the third
century only the first germs existed of that Church-life
which subsequently was to reach so rich a development.
The cessation of persecution removed those
hindrances which up to then had stood in the way of its
evolution.</p>

<p>The increase of festivals can now be traced with the
assistance of secular legislation, inasmuch as the Christian
Emperors prohibited the sitting of the law-courts and
games in the circus on certain days. It has been already
shown that Constantine, as early as 321, appointed that
no legal business should be transacted on all Sundays
of the year. In a proclamation concerning the regulation
of legal vacations, put forth by Valentinian II.
and his colleague in the Empire, and dated from Rome on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the 7th August 389, the seven days before and after
Easter are added to the Sundays.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In the same way as
special sittings of the law-courts were abolished on
Sundays, so, later on, the proceedings before the judge
of arbitration were forbidden.</p>

<p>When a day became recognised as exempt from legal
business, this did not at once render it a festival or holy
day, otherwise, according to the law of 389, there would
have been fifteen consecutive holy days. The prohibition
of legal proceedings in the courts on a given
day, had regard, in the first place, to the removal of all
hindrances which might interfere with attendance at
divine worship on the part of those employed therein.
In the second place, however, it must be remembered
that in those days the sittings of the criminal courts
almost always implied the application of torture; and
such proceedings on holy days seemed especially out of
place. This must also have been the reason why
Valentinian and his colleague forbade prosecutions in
the criminal courts throughout the whole of Lent.
He certainly did not aim at changing all the days of
Lent into feast-days. This law was renewed by
Justinian.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The legislation concerning Christmas and Epiphany
exhibits a good deal of vacillation, probably connected
with the fact that these two festivals were not yet
generally celebrated and recognised everywhere in the
fourth century. They seem to have been originally
mentioned in the law of 389, but to have been struck
out by the redactors of the <i>Codex Theodosianus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It
was only through the inclusion of the law in question in
the Code of Justinian that they were finally marked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
as days on which the law-courts did not sit. This
privilege had been already taken away from heathen
festivals by a law of Valentinian and his colleague in 392.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Alongside these laws we find others forbidding
games in the Circus and in the theatres. These interfered
with the attendance of many persons at divine
service as much as, or even more than, the proceedings
in the law-courts, for they began early in the morning
and lasted the whole day. Valentinian II. and his
colleague, on the 19th June 386, re-enacted one of their
earlier laws forbidding the performance of such plays
on Sundays.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Through later legislation, it came to pass
that the same held good for the seven days before and
after Easter as well, and in 395 were added all the days
of the year which were regarded as <i>feriæ</i>.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Finally,
a law of Theodosius II. of 1st February 425, gives a list
of all those days on which these spectacles (<i>theatrorum
atque circensium voluptas</i>) were forbidden. These were
all the Sundays of the year, Christmas, Epiphany, and
the whole period from Easter to Pentecost.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
400 Arcadius and Honorius forbade races on Sundays,
plainly for the reason that they drew away the people
from divine service.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In order to illustrate the increase in the number of
festivals, we make use, as we have said, of the official
decrees on the subject put forth by the authorities both
in Church and State, where such are at our disposal.
The service-books, which do not always give the distinction
between <i>festa in choro</i> and <i>in foro</i> with precision,
will be consulted when necessary.</p>

<p>A list of feasts and sacred seasons appears for the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
time in the fifth book of the Apostolic Constitutions, viz.
the Birthday of our Lord (25th December), Epiphany,
Lent, the Holy Week of the Passover, the Passover of
the Resurrection, the Sunday after Easter, on which is
read the Gospel of unbelieving Thomas, Ascension, and
Pentecost. This gives the festivals in the fourth
century. Other evidence of the same period, <i>i.e.</i> the
sermons of Chrysostom and others, affords certain proof
for the existence of five or six festivals only, according
as Good Friday is included among them or not, viz.
Christmas, Epiphany, the Passion, the Resurrection,
the Ascension of Christ, and Pentecost.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>A list of the festivals celebrated at Tours and in the
neighbouring Abbey of St Martin’s during the fifth
century, is given us by Perpetuus (461-91), the sixth
bishop of the see.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In this is shown the days on
which the principal service is held in the cathedral,
and those on which it is held in other churches in the
town:—</p>

<p>The regulations for festivals contained in the statutes
of Sonnatius, Bishop of Reims (614-31), show a further
development. It marks as festivals: <i>Nativitas Domini</i>,
<i>Circumcisio</i>, <i>Epiphania</i>, <i>Annunciatio Beatæ Mariæ</i>,
<i>Resurrectio Domini cum die sequenti</i>, <i>Ascensio Domini</i>,
<i>dies Pentecostes</i>, <i>Nativitas beati Joannis Baptistæ</i>,
<i>Nativitas apostolorum Petri et Pauli</i>, <i>Assumptio beatæ
Mariæ</i>, <i>ejusdem Nativitas</i>, <i>Nativitas Andreæ apostoli
et omnes dies dominicales</i>. These thirteen days were to
be celebrated “<i>absque omni opere forensi</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The
omission of Candlemas Day is remarkable. The day
after Easter appears for the first time as a holy day.
The Council of Maçon, however, had already gone
further and forbidden (Can. 2) servile work throughout
the whole of Easter week. This extension of the
festival was probably at that time unique, while we
often meet with it in the ninth century, when it had
probably become general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>According to this document, the number of days
which in the course of the year were exempt from labour
did not exceed sixty-three in the seventh century. Their
number was considerably increased in the subsequent
period. In the notes on festivals ascribed to St Boniface,
it has increased to seventy-one, including the two
Sundays on which Easter and Pentecost fall. These
notes are included in the collection known as <i>statuta
quædam S. Bonifacii</i>,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and even if they do not owe
their origin to St Boniface, they belong without doubt
to his period. Days in which rest from labour (<i>sabbatismus</i>)
is enjoined in this document are Christmas
(four days), the Circumcision, Epiphany, Purification,
Easter (four days), Ascension, Nativity of St John the
Baptist, the festival of SS. Peter and Paul, the
Assumption, the Nativity of Our Lady, St Andrew’s
Day (30th November). Pentecost is passed over because
it has already been mentioned in the thirty-fourth
canon, but it was to be celebrated in the same manner as
Easter, that is, during four days with a vigil.</p>

<p>In the Frankish Empire, during the ninth century, the
regulations for holy days were everywhere reduced to
order, and in consequence we possess numerous ordinances
bearing on the subject. With the exception of
festivals of local saints and patrons, they present little
variety. With regard to the <i>Assumptio B.V.M.</i> alone,
there seems to have been some fluctuations in France at
the beginning of the ninth century, as a statement of
the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle in 809 proves. The Council
enumerates the following festivals: <i>Natalis Domini</i>,
<i>natales S. Stephani</i>, <i>S. Joannis Evangelistæ</i>, <i>SS. Innocentium</i>,
<i>octabas Domini</i> (the Circumcision), <i>Epiphania</i>,
<i>Purificatio S. Mariæ</i>, <i>Pascha dies octo</i>, <i>Litania major,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
scensa Domini</i>, <i>Pentecoste</i>, <i>natales S. Joannis Baptistæ</i>,
<i>SS. Petri et Pauli</i>, <i>S. Martini</i>, <i>S. Andreæ</i>. <i>De Assumptione
S. Mariæ interrogandum reliquimus.</i><a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The Council
of Mainz in 813, however, in its thirty-sixth canon, includes
this last festival along with the others, as well as
the <i>litania</i> with four days, <i>i.e.</i> including the preceding
Sunday. It also directs that, besides the commemoration
of those martyrs and confessors whose relics repose
within the diocese, the anniversary of the dedication of
the church shall also be celebrated.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> About the same
time, <i>i.e.</i> in 827, Bishop Hetto of Basle put out a
statute, in the eighth chapter of which the festivals
entailing rest from servile work (<i>dies feriandi</i>) are
enumerated: Christmas and the three following days,
<i>Octava Domini</i>, <i>Theophania</i>, <i>Purificatio S.M.</i>, <i>Pascha</i>
(which, according to the seventh chapter, was prolonged
for eight days), the three Rogation days, the Ascension,
the Saturday before Pentecost, St John Baptist, the
festivals of the Apostles, <i>Assumptio S. Mariæ</i>, St
Michael, the Dedication of the Church, and the Feast
of the patron saint, these two last to be observed
locally. Three other days, <i>i.e.</i> St Remigius, St Maurice,
and St Martin, were not exempt from servile work.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
This arrangement differs from the preceding, inasmuch
as it includes all the Apostles, while the other mentions
only SS. Peter and Paul, and St Andrew. The
festivals of the Apostles are also absent from the list
given by the Council of Mainz in 809.</p>

<p>The Council of Mainz in 813, and the statutes of
Bishop Rudolph of Bourges and Bishop Walter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Orleans in the same century, prescribe eight days for
the festival of Pentecost, as well as for Easter, and
mention in addition the Nativity of our Lady and St
Remigius as festivals.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The Council of Ingelheim in
948 retained the Easter octave but reduced the festival
of Pentecost to four days, which were finally reduced to
three by the Council of Constance.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> A few additions to
these festivals are given in the collections of canons put
out at a subsequent period by Burchard of Worms<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
and Ivo of Chartres.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The Canon Law contains two lists of festivals, the one
representing the state of things in the twelfth, the other
that in the thirteenth century. The former, in the
decretal of Gratian,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> enumerates all the Sundays in the
year from Vespers to Vespers, and then, throughout the
year, the following days are exempt from servile work:
Christmas and the three following days, St Silvester,
<i>Octava Domini</i>, <i>Theophania</i>, <i>Purificatio S. Mariæ</i>,
Easter and the entire Easter week, the three Rogation
days, the Ascension, the days of Pentecost (probably
three), St John the Baptist’s Day, all the Apostles, St
Lawrence, <i>Assumptio</i> and <i>Nativitas B.M.V.</i>, the Dedication
of the Church, St Michael and All Saints, and,
finally, the festivals approved by the bishop of the
diocese. This list exhibits a further increase on its
predecessors.</p>

<p>The decretal of Gregory IX., <i>Conquestus est nobis</i>, of
the year 1232,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> is important for the Middle Ages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
although it does not represent the highest point in the
development. According to it, legal business was not
to be transacted on the <i>Natalis Domini, S. Stephani,
Joannis Evangelistæ, SS. Innocentium, S. Silvestri,
Circumcisionis, Epiphaniæ, Septem Diebus Dominicæ
Passionis, Resurrectionis cum septem Sequentibus, Ascensionis,
Pentecostes cum duobus qui sequuntur, Nativitatis
Baptistæ, Festivitatum omnium Virginis Gloriosæ,
Duodecim Apostolorum et præcipue Petri et Pauli, Beati
Laurentii, Dedicationis Beati Michælis, Sollemnitatis
omnium Sanctorum ac Diebus Dominicis ceterisque
sollemnitatibus, quas singuli episcopi in suis diæcesibus
cum clero et populo duxerint sollemniter celebrandas</i>.
Setting down the number of Our Lady’s feasts as five,
and the Apostles’ as eleven, we have here ninety-five
days in the year on which no legal proceedings took place,
not counting the particular festivals of the country and
diocese. The above-mentioned decretal is silent concerning
servile work. We may assume that there were
ten out of the fifteen days exempt from legal proceedings
on which servile work was permitted, and thus the total
of days exempt from labour must have amounted
to eighty-five in the course of the year, omitting the
festivals proper to the diocese.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>With this, the highest point of development was
almost attained, for only a very few festivals were added
later, such as <i>Corpus Christi</i>, and, for certain localities,
the Conception of Our Blessed Lady, and one or two
more, but the number of local festivals might, under
certain circumstances, be largely augmented. Between
the thirteenth and the eighteenth centuries there were
dioceses in which the number of days exempt from
labour reached or even exceeded a hundred, so that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
generally speaking, in every week there was another
day besides the Sunday on which ordinary occupations
were laid aside.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In some dioceses<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the number of
festivals observed exceeded those proscribed by lawful
authority.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In the Byzantine Empire the number of days exempt
from legal proceedings was even more considerable than
in the West. A distinction was made between whole
holidays and half holidays. The Emperor Manuel
Comnenus reduced their number by a constitution,
dated March 1166. According to this, the first-class
comprised no fewer than sixty-six days, not including
Sundays, and the second comprised twenty-seven.</p>

<p>From the Calendar of Calcasendi,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> we learn what were
the festivals observed by the Copts in Egypt, in the
eighth century, under Mahomedan rule. They distinguished
between greater and lesser festivals, and kept
seven of each.</p>

<p>The greater festivals are:—</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>1. <i>Annuntiatio</i>, Calcasendi adds: <i>Innuunt per eam
annuntiationem consolatoris, qui ipse est juxta
eorum disciplinam Gabriel, Mariæ, super quam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
sit pax, de nativitate Jesu, super quam sit
misericordia Dei.</i> The festival was held on
29th Barchamoth—25th March.</p>

<p>2. <i>Olivarum s. festum palmarum in die solis postremo
jejunii illorum</i>, <i>alias</i> <i>festum Alschacaniu</i> (a corruption
of Hosanna), Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>3. <i>Pascha celebrant die solutionis jejunii eorum.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>Feria quinta quadraginta</i> (<i>scil.</i> <i>dierum</i>), <i>i.e.</i> <i>festum
ascensionis</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>Festum quinque</i> (<i>scil.</i> <i>decadum dierum</i>), <i>i.e.</i> <i>pentecoste</i>.</p>

<p>6. <i>Nativitas Domini.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>Immersio</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>baptismus Domini</i>, Epiphany.</p>

</div>

<p>The lesser festivals are:—</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>1. <i>Circumcisio Domini.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Quadragesima</i> (<i>scil.</i> <i>dies</i>, reckoned from Christmas),
Candlemas Day; the date 8th Mesori is given.</p>

<p>3. <i>Feria quinta confœderations sive testimonii</i>, Maundy
Thursday.</p>

<p>4. <i>Sabbatum Luminis</i>, Holy Saturday.</p>

<p>5. <i>Festum claudens s. terminans est octiduo post pascha</i>,
Low Sunday.</p>

<p>6. <i>Festum transfigurationis</i> (6th August).</p>

<p>7. <i>Festum crucis</i>, on the 14th September.</p>

</div>

<p>For the Egyptian Christians, Good Friday was not a
festival of either the first or second class. In this it stood
in marked distinction from the preceding and following
days—Maundy Thursday and Holy Saturday, which
were regarded as festivals of the second class.</p>

<p>The festivals observed in the latter period of the
Byzantine Empire under the Paleologi are found in the
treatise of an official of the palace, George Codinus, <i>De
Officiis Palatii</i>, in which detailed information is given of
the costume, insignia, etc., with which the Emperor and
his courtiers attended divine service in the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
churches of the capital. Beside the great festivals—Christmas,
Epiphany, Hypapante, Easter, and Pentecost—the
following days were distinguished by the
attendance of the Court at divine service: the First
Sunday in Lent, called by the Greeks Orthodox Sunday,
Palm Sunday, Holy Saturday and the Easter Octave,
the 1st September being New Year’s Day. To these
were added a great number of saints’ days, <i>i.e.</i> 1st
January, St Basil; 23rd April, St George; 21st May,
Constantine; 24th June, Nativity of St John the Baptist;
30th June, the Feast of the Apostles; 8th August,
the Transfiguration; 15th August, the Assumption
(κοίμησις τῆς ὑπεραγίας θεοτόκου); 29th August, the
Beheading of St John the Baptist; 31st August or 2nd
July, the Translation of Our Lady’s garment to the
Church of the Blachernæ; 8th September, the Nativity
of Our Lady; 14th September, the Invention of the
Cross (ὕψωσις τοῦ σταυροῦ); 26th October, Feast
of the Martyr Demetrius Myroblyta; 13th November,
St Chrysostom; 21st November, the Presentation of Our
Lady in the Temple; and, finally, the day of the
Resurrection of Lazarus, which was kept on the
Saturday before Palm Sunday. The Court did not
attend divine service on Good Friday, although it
did on Holy Saturday. No mention is made of the
Ascension.</p>

<p>The large increase in festivals in the Middle Ages was
due to the fact that the bishops exercised the right
given them by Canon Law,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of introducing new feasts
within the limits of their dioceses. This arose from the
ancient custom, that it belonged to them to watch over
the cultus of the martyrs, and it depended upon their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
authorisation whether or not a given martyr should be
recognised and venerated as such. Later, when the
religious orders became widespread and influential, it
usually happened that some monastery began to
venerate a mystery or a saint, and then, as this cultus
was taken up by the people, other monasteries, or the
whole Order, adopted the festival,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and, finally, the
bishops gave their approbation to the institution of the
holy day in question. Lastly, the civil power and the
Roman See intervened, and the new holy day was in this
way fully sanctioned. Things, however, did not always
proceed so far, for in many cases the festival was confined
to a single diocese, the result being great variety in
particulars and general uncertainty. These abuses
became more deeply felt in course of time, and so Urban
VIII., in his constitution <i>Universa per orbem</i>, published
in 1642, warns the bishops not to use their rights in this
respect for the future, and at the present day these
rights, without having been abrogated, are regarded as
antiquated.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The fact that formerly the bishops enjoyed the right of
introducing festivals into their dioceses, or of excluding
them, must constantly be borne in mind, because, if it
is left out of sight, the institution and development of
even a single festival cannot be understood, much less
the historical development of the whole festal cycle.
When we realise that this principle was acted upon
from the beginning, and for more than a thousand years,
during a period remarkable for its rich development in
many directions, the wonder is that the result is as
harmonious and systematic as it is. No departure was
made from the natural basis upon which the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
was built up, and the attempts of the Councils were
all in the direction of uniformity.</p>

<p>The abuses resulting from the excessive multiplication
of holy days was remarked upon even in Catholic times,
especially by John Gerson, at a provincial synod at
Reims in 1408, and by Nicholas de Clemangiis, who,
in a work<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> devoted to that purpose, published about
1416, spoke out boldly against the introduction of any
more festivals. In the sixteenth century, the Protestants
in their <i>Gravamina</i> denounced the great number
of festivals, and already in 1524 the legate Campeggio
settled their number, and so put an end to their
arbitrary increase for the future.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>By the introduction of diocesan and local festivals,
the number of holy days became excessive in some
localities, and great uncertainty arose as to which
festivals should be celebrated by all, in accordance with
the general precepts of the Church, and which should not.
This, and the complaints of the poor that they were
prevented by the number of holy days from gaining
their livelihood, while others again took advantage of
them to indulge in laziness or the pursuit of pleasure,
was the ground which Gerson had already adduced in
his time. The same reasons now induced Pope Urban
VIII. to regulate the arrangements of festivals and to
fix limits for the whole Church beyond which it would
not be lawful to go. For this purpose, he published,
on the 24th September 1642, the important constitution
<i>Universa per orbem</i>, in which the following holy days are
prescribed: 1. Feasts of our Lord—Christmas, Easter
and Pentecost, with the two following days, New Year,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Epiphany, the Ascension, Trinity, Corpus Christi, the
Invention of the Cross. 2. Feasts of Our Lady—Candlemas,
the Annunciation, the Assumption, and the
Nativity. 3. Saints’ Days—St Michael (8th May),
Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and Paul,
St Andrew, St James, St John, St Thomas, SS. Phillip
and James, St Bartholomew, St Matthew, SS. Simon
and Jude, St Matthias, St Lawrence, St Silvester,
St Joseph, St Anne, All Saints’, and the patron saint
of the country. The actual reduction was small,
and concerned chiefly the lesser saints days, such
as St Mary Magdalene, St Cecilia, St Catherine,
St Martin, etc. A more important consequence of
this constitution was, that the original right of
the bishop to appoint festivals, although recognised
by the Council of Trent, was rendered practically
ineffective.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, the hatred against the Church
which showed itself at the Courts of the Bourbon
sovereigns, and the so-called advance of culture, necessitated
fresh regulations on this point. First of all,
at the request of the provincial synod of Tarragona in
1727, Pope Benedict XIII. consented to the reduction
of the number of festivals for a part of Spain. From
this arose the distinction between half and whole holy
days.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Rest from servile work was maintained only
on the Sundays and seventeen festivals, <i>i.e.</i> half the
number given in the list above, and for the other
seventeen days it was enjoined that the faithful assist
at Mass only. After attendance at divine service, all
kinds of work were to be permitted. This permission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
was extended in 1748, by Benedict XIV., to Naples,
Sicily, and several Spanish dioceses.</p>

<p>The same Pope extended this reduction of festivals
to Austria in 1754, inasmuch as only fifteen complete
holy days besides Sundays were left; while on the other
days, which were to be observed according to the provisions
of the bull, <i>Universa per orbem</i>, it was enjoined
that Mass should be heard and the fast kept on their vigil.
This last injunction soon fell into disuse, and even
assistance at Mass on the suppressed holy days was not
strictly observed. Accordingly, the Empress Maria
Teresa desired an alteration, and Pope Clement XIV.
issued a new brief in 1771. In this, the direction to
keep a fast on the vigil of the suppressed festivals,
and to attend mass, was set aside, and the following
festivals were prescribed to be kept as complete holy
days; Christmas, St Stephen’s Day, New Year, Epiphany,
Easter (two days), the Ascension, Pentecost (two
days), Corpus Christi, SS. Peter and Paul, All Saints,
the five principle feasts of our Lady, and the festival
of the patron saint of the country, <i>i.e.</i> eighteen days
in addition to the Sundays. A similar arrangement was
introduced, in 1772, into the then electorate of Bavaria,
in 1775, into Poland and East Prussia, and in 1791, into
the whole of Spain.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Under Pius VI. permission was frequently given for
the reduction of the number of festivals at the request of
certain dioceses and districts as appears from the
<i>bullarium</i> of this Pope.</p>

<p>It became necessary to make new arrangements concerning
festivals for Prussia, after the incorporation of
Silesia. This was effected by a brief of Clement XIV.
of the 24th June 1772, especially granted to the diocese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of Breslau, but applying to all Prussia as it then existed.
The festivals retained were: Easter, Pentecost, and
Christmas (each two days), the Circumcision, Epiphany,
the Ascension, Corpus Christi, five feasts of Our Lady,
(<i>i.e.</i> the Purification, Annunciation, Assumption,
Nativity, and Conception), SS. Peter and Paul and All
Saints. Where there were several patron saints, only
one, the principal, was to be celebrated.</p>

<p>These regulations remained in force only until 1788,
for King Frederick William II. requested a further
reduction in the number of festivals through his agent
in Rome, Ciofani. In consequence of this, Pius VI.
transferred the feasts of the Assumption and Nativity
of our Lady to the Sundays following, and, at the express
wish of the King, appointed that the Wednesday in the
third week after Easter, one of the Protestant days of
penitence and prayer, should rank as a festival, an order
that all might implore the same God for a fruitful
harvest. In compensation for the suppressed festivals
of the Apostles and other Saints, there was to be
observed the commemoration of all the Apostles on the
29th June, and a similar commemoration of all the holy
martyrs on the 26th December. These had already been
appointed by Clement XIV.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>These regulations remained in force for Prussia, and
were even extended to its newly acquired territories
by a brief of Leo XII., dated 2nd December 1828.
By this means, the districts on the left bank of
the Rhine, which, while under French dominion had
only kept the four holidays prescribed by the Code
Napoleon, again enjoyed a notable increase in the
number of festivals. In order that this might not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
interfere with the livelihood of the industrial classes,
who had to compete with Protestants, it was conceded
at the representations of Archbishop von Spiegel that,
in the industrial districts, servile labour might be
performed after attendance at Mass on the festivals introduced
in obedience to the brief of Leo XII. Owing to
the deeply religious character of the district in question,
very little use was ever made of this concession, and it
has accordingly become obsolete. This is the origin of
the regulations for Catholic festivals at present in force
in Prussia. In one point, however, an alteration has
been made, for when the Protestant day of penitence
in prayer which falls in November, was fixed by
authority in 1893, the Catholics fell in with the arrangement,
and now celebrate the Presentation of our Lady
in the Temple as a movable feast on the same day.</p>

<p>The greatest alterations in respect of the Church’s holy
days was caused by the French Revolution. By a decree
of the Convention on 5th October 1793, the Christian
mode of reckoning was abolished and a new mode
substituted for it. The years were to be reckoned from
the establishment of the French Republic on 22nd
September 1792. The division of time into weeks was
also abolished and the months, now uniformly of thirty
days, were divided into the decades. The French
observed this mode of reckoning until 1st January 1806.
While it was in force, Napoleon undertook the re-establishment
of ecclesiastical affairs in France, and as
far as the regulations for holy days are concerned, traces
of the then existing state of things survives until the
present day. For the Church had to fall in with the
reckoning then in force, to the extent of either abolishing
all holy days which fell in the week, or of transferring
them to the Sunday. According to the ordinance of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Cardinal Legate Caprara, dated Paris, 9th April 1802,
only four holy days were left, <i>i.e.</i> Christmas, Ascension,
the Assumption (because the 15th August was Napoleon’s
name-day), and All Saints. This ordinance affected all
France as it was then, that is including the Netherlands,
and the whole left bank of the Rhine.</p>

<p>In the Appendix<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> will be found a detailed list of the
festivals observed in different countries upon which
servile work is forbidden. A list of this kind, in
addition to its practical value, is instructive as
showing how the interests of religion are affected
by the culture and social conditions of each country
at a given period, and also how politics have intruded
themselves into the sphere of religion. The
latter fact is especially prominent in Protestantism.
From the beginning, Protestantism was affected by two
opposing streams—one favourable to the observance of
festivals, prevailing among the Lutheran, the other
opposed to it, prevailing among the Calvinists. Luther
wished to retain all feasts of our Lord, and even
Epiphany, Candlemas, the Annunciation found favour
with him as such. Saints days and the two festivals
of the Holy Cross were alone to be abolished. Certain
secular governments tolerated even more festivals,
such as St Michael and St John the Baptist. The Church
Order of Brandenburg retained the feasts of Apostles,
and even Corpus Christi, but without a procession, and
the Assumption—this last for the sake of the peasants.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
The same regulations were observed in Saxony and
Würtemburg. Strict Calvinism retained only Christmas,
Easter, and Pentecost; its spread and increasing
influence manifested itself gradually in the regulations
concerning festivals. The Prussian Union,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
and the <i>Agenda</i> of the so-called Evangelical State
Church of 1895 recognise as holy days of obligation
only the three principal festivals, each with two holidays,
<i>i.e.</i> the Sunday and the Monday, New Year,
Epiphany, Good Friday, the Ascension, along with
the days of penitence and prayer. Contrary to the
principles of Calvinism, the Established Church of
England possesses a Calendar richly furnished with
festivals.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHURCH’S YEAR</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>A. <span class="smcap">Easter, and the Sacred Seasons connected with Easter</span></h4>

<h5>1. <i>Easter, its Name and History</i></h5>

<p>Were it our object to deal with the Church’s year as
affording material for a series of doctrinal instructions,
we should begin with Christmas, the festival of Christ’s
birth, for, so viewed, the ecclesiastical year becomes
chiefly a compendium of the chief acts in the drama of
our salvation, and recalls in orderly succession the
principal events in our Saviour’s life. But if we make
the Church’s year in itself the object of our studies,
especially if we deal with it historically, we are bound
to commence with Easter, because, in order of time, it
existed from the first and formed the natural starting-point
for all the rest. It did not, as other festivals,
come into existence gradually, but formed a connecting
link with the Old Testament, and was, in the strictest
sense of the words, the appointment of a Higher Power,
providentially ordering all things according to Its good
pleasure. Easter owes its origin not to human wisdom,
or piety: it comes to us with higher sanctions.</p>

<p>Easter is the chief festival of Christendom, the first
and oldest of all festivals, the basis on which the Church’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
year is built, the connecting link with the festivals of the
Old Covenant, and the central point on which depends
the date of the other movable feasts. At an early
date, the Fathers mention Easter as the most important
of the festivals, as, for example, St Leo the Great,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> on the
grounds that the incarnation and birth of the Son of
God served as a prelude to the mystery of the Resurrection,
and that Christ had no other purpose in being
born of a woman than that He should be nailed to the
Cross for us.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Other Fathers and the Roman martyrology
call it the feast of feasts (<i>festum festorum</i>).</p>

<p>With regard to the name, the English word “Easter”
comes from Eastre, in German “Ostra,”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> the goddess
of Spring worshipped by the ancient Saxons and Angles,
whose name survives in many place-names, such as
Osterode, Osterberg, etc. In her honour fires, known as
the Easter fires, were kindled in spring. In Latin, we
find at first <i>dominica resurrectionis</i> alone used in the
liturgy, never <i>Pascha</i>. <i>Pascha</i> has no connection with
the Greek πάσχω, but is the Aramaic form of <i>pesach</i>, to
pass over, ‎‏פַּסְחָח‎‏ for ‎‏פֶּסַח‎‏. In Christian times, the similarity
in the sound of the words easily suggested, by a
sort of play upon the words, that which to Christians
is the chief object of the Easter festival. In the Pentateuch,
<i>pascha</i> is only found in the strict sense of <i>transitus</i>,
<i>phase</i>.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The points to be dealt with regarding Easter are its
antiquity, and its connection, in point of view of time
and of signification, with the Jewish Passover, with
which it is connected by the death of Christ, as well as by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the day on which that death took place. Then, the
character and duration of the feast, the preparatory
solemnity of Lent, and the subsequent Octave must be
dealt with.</p>

<p>With regard to Easter and its antiquity in early
ecclesiastical literature, the Apostolic Fathers, owing
to the questions dealt with in their writings, do not
mention it. Only in the interpolated letter of Ignatius
to the Philippians (c. 14) is Easter mentioned. The
passage is directed against the Quartodecimans, which
of itself is proof of its later date. Nothing is to be found
in the Didaché or in the pseudo-Clementine Homilies.
When we come to the apologists, we find no reference
to Easter in Justin’s Dialogue with Trypho (c. 40), and
nothing in either of his Apologies. Clement of Alexandria
speaks only of the Jewish passover, without
referring to the Christian feast. Melito of Sardis,
however, wrote an entire treatise on the festival of
Easter, in the year when Servilius Paulus was Pro-Consul
of Asia, for at that time a disagreement concerning
Easter had broken out in Laodicea. Clement of
Alexandria replied to Melito, who had written in defence
of the Quartodeciman practice.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>In 198, when the difference between Asia and the rest
of the Church concerning Easter came under discussion,
an exchange of letters took place between the leading
authorities of the Church, Pope Victor, Bishop Narcissus
of Jerusalem, Polycrates of Ephesus, Bacchylus of
Corinth, Irenæus, and others taking part. Irenæus
composed a special treatise <i>De Paschate</i>, sometimes
called <i>De Schismate</i>, unfortunately lost. In the fragments
falsely attributed to him, Easter is referred to in
the third and seventh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>References to Easter are frequent in Tertullian.
With regard to the name, it is to be noticed that with
him <i>pascha</i> denotes, not the single day of the Easter
festival, but a longer period of time, in which a fast was
observed and baptism administered,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in other words,
Passion-tide and the Easter Octave.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Moreover, for
the actual day of our Lord’s death, he uses the word,
<i>parasceve</i>.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The festival of Easter, as he further relates,
was kept in the first month (<i>i.e.</i> March),<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and was prefigured
by the Jewish Passover.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> We possess a treatise
on Easter, of the year 243 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, formerly attributed
wrongly to St Cyprian, but, probably, a translation of
work of Theophilus of Cæsarea. It is entitled <i>De
Paschate Computus</i>, and was written elsewhere than
at Rome, in the interest of the Easter cycle of sixteen
years drawn up by Hippolytus. The remarks of
Hippolytus on the Quartodecimans afford us important
evidence for the Ante-Nicene period. “These,” he says,
“agree with the Church in preserving all the apostolic
traditions, but differ from her in one point, inasmuch as,
out of contentiousness, wilfulness, and ignorance, they
maintain that the Christian feast must always be kept
on the 14th Nisan, no matter on what day of the week
it falls.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>If the Arabic Canons ascribed to Hippolytus, especially
the twenty-second, are really his, it would appear
that he held Easter might be kept in the same week as
the Jewish Passover, but on the Sunday, and should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
preceded by a week’s fast on bread and water.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> This
date coincides with the Easter cycle of sixteen years
drawn up by Hippolytus, and which, after all, is only
the Jewish cycle of eight years doubled.</p>

<p>The seventh and sixty-ninth of the so-called Apostolic
Canons refer to Easter and its preparatory fast.
The seventh is also important on account of what it says
about the period within which Easter may fall: “Whosoever
keeps Easter with the Jews before the vernal
equinox, let him be anathema.” From which it appears
that the Jewish Passover could fall before the vernal
equinox. The last day of Nisan alone must never
precede the equinox, and, consequently, the Passover
must frequently have fallen before the 21st March, and
may have done so in the year of our Lord’s death.</p>

<p>Of Eusebius’ treatise on Easter,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> dedicated to the
Emperor, only a portion remains and this contains
nothing either about Easter or its date. Constantine
gratefully accepted the dedication in a letter which
Eusebius, not without vanity, incorporated in his <i>Vita
Constantini</i> (4, 35). The Emperor’s encyclical,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> communicating
to the churches the conclusions concerning
Easter arrived at by the Nicene Council, would have been
more deserving of a place in the same work.</p>

<h5>2. <i>The Connection of the Christian Festival with
the Jewish</i></h5>

<p>The connection between the Christian and the Jewish
feasts is both historical and ideal—historical because
our Lord’s death happened on the 15th Nisan, the first
day of the Jewish feast; ideal, because what took place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
had been prefigured in the Old Testament by types of
which it was itself the antitype.</p>

<p>The Jewish Passover was a repetition of what had
taken place on the evening of the exodus from Egypt.
On that occasion, the children of Israel had killed a lamb
and marked their doorposts with its blood in order that
the destroying angel might pass over their houses. Then,
dressed for the journey, they had consumed the lamb
at a ceremonial meal. This last meal of which the
Israelites partook in Egypt on the eve of their departure,
<i>i.e.</i> on the 14th Nisan, was of a religious character,
and was, on this account, to be repeated every year on
the same day, and at the same hour, as a memorial
feast, at which each father of a family had to
instruct his household in the signification of the rites
they were performing.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The manner of celebrating the feast was minutely
prescribed. Each householder, for example, had to
choose a lamb without blemish of the first year, on the
10th of the first month, <i>i.e.</i> Nisan, as it came to be called
later, or, if he had none in his own herd, he must procure
one from elsewhere and keep it in readiness for the
feast on the evening of the 14th Nisan. The lamb was
to be killed, roasted, and eaten by the household, who
remained standing, along with unleavened bread, and
bitter herbs, nothing being allowed to remain over.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
From this onwards to the 21st Nisan inclusive, unleavened
bread was alone to be eaten, and hence the period from
the 15th to the 21st Nisan was called the days of unleavened
bread. The first and last days, the 15th
and the 21st, were regarded as especially sacred, and
servile work was forbidden on them.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> During the
whole week, holocausts, meat offerings, and sin offerings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
were offered daily in the Temple on behalf of the entire
people, as well as offerings presented by individual
believers on their own behalf. The 16th Nisan was
marked by an offering of a special kind, that of the first-fruits
of harvest, consisting of the presentation of a sheaf
of ripe barley along with the offering of a yearling
lamb.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> This offering of the first ripe fruits served
also to mark the time when the Passover was to be
celebrated, for, owing to the fact that the Jewish year
did not begin on a fixed date, this had to be in some
way determined by a stated event in the order of
nature. In Palestine the barley was already ripe by
March.</p>

<p>Several of the actions prescribed at the offering of this
lamb pointed forward to the atoning death of the Messias,
such as the sprinkling of the doorposts with its blood,
in order that the destroying angel might pass over the
house, and the direction that none of the lamb’s bones
were to be broken. There were also several other
small particulars which emphasised and completed the
ideal connection between the sacrifice of the Passover
and that of the Cross, as certain Fathers perceived at an
early date.</p>

<p>Isaias, speaking in his prophecy, of the sufferings of
the Messias, calls Him the Lamb chosen by God, who
bears the iniquity of others.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> St John the Baptist
pointed out Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away
the sins of the world, and by the writers of the New
Testament the same idea is frequently employed. St
John the Evangelist expressly refers to the typical
character of the Passover rites, when he applies the
passage, “A bone of it shall not be broken,”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> to Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
on the Cross, and sees its fulfilment in the fact that the
soldiers refrained from breaking His limbs. St Paul
declares in general that the sacrifice of Christ replaces
the Passover, and sees a typical signification in the
unleavened bread.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It appears, he had no objection
to Christians holding a Passover supper, although, elsewhere
he expresses himself strongly against their continuing
to observe Jewish practices, such as Sabbaths
and new moons.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> As to the Fathers, it is sufficient,
to quote Justin and Tertullian,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> who in particular see
in the fact that the Passover lamb was transfixed in two
pieces of wood arranged cross-wise, a figure of the Cross
in which Christ was stretched. Speaking generally,
there is no doubt the Jewish Passover was taken over
into Christianity, and thereby its typical ceremonies
found their true fulfilment.</p>

<p>Apart from the relation of the sacrifice of Christ’s
death to the Jewish Passover, and its dogmatic signification,
sentiment and mere human feeling would have
led Christians to regard with reverence the day on which
our Lord, the Founder of the Church, died, and to keep
the day sacred in each succeeded year on which He
had offered the sacrifice of Himself. But for this it
was necessary, in the first place, to know on what day
exactly His death had taken place.</p>

<p>For the Jews, this was easy; it was the 15th Nisan
in their Calendar, but for Christians of other countries,
it was very difficult. In the Roman Empire, to which
they all belonged, different methods of reckoning time
and different calendars were in use. Since 45 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the
Romans themselves used the revised Julian Calendar,
leaving at the same time perfect freedom to subject<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
nations either to adopt it, or continue their own methods.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Chief among the existing systems were the Egyptian,
the Syro-Macedonian, and the Semitic, each with its
own way of dating the year. The two first systems
admitted of being brought into agreement with the
Roman Calendar, with more or less difficulty, since,
according to them, the year began on a fixed date, but
with the Jewish Calendar it was not so, for its was based
on the lunar year, and never synchronised with the solar
year as to the beginning of months and years. The
Egyptian year, at the commencement of the Christian
era, began on the 29th August, and consisted of twelve
months of thirty days each, and five additional days
(ἐπαγόμεναι) belonging to no month. Every fourth
year was a leap-year, namely the third, seventh, eleventh,
fifteenth year, according to the Julian reckoning. The
Syro-Macedonian Calendar commenced with the
autumnal equinox. The Syrians, however, later on,
partially adopted the Julian Calendar in a somewhat
modified form.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The Egyptian system of introducing
additional days was essentially the same as the
Roman, except that their leap-year was always one
year in advance of the Roman leap-year. To their
usual five additional days, they added yet one more,
making a total of six. Consequently the next year,
<i>i.e.</i> the fourth, eighth, twelfth, sixteenth, etc., began
on the 30th instead of the 29th August.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> For reckoning
years, the Egyptians made use of the years of the
sovereign’s reign, but as they began the year with the
1st Thoth, preceding the proclamation of the sovereign’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
accession, it often happened that more years than
he was entitled to were set down to one sovereign,
while another who had reigned for less than a year was
simply passed over.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>It was extremely difficult for those nations, whose
Calendars were arranged on a different system, to fix
the day of Christ’s death by their own chronology, for
the Jewish 15th Nisan might fall on widely different
days, sometimes in March, sometimes in April. How
difficult it was to discover, the days on which the death
and resurrection of Christ ought to be commemorated,
will become more obvious from what follows.</p>

<h5>3. <i>The circumstances which led to Easter being a
movable Feast</i></h5>

<p>To the real and historical connection between the
Christian Easter and the Jewish Passover, is due the
explanation of a striking peculiarity in the Church’s
year, viz., the movable feasts, of which Easter is the
starting-point. Easter falls on no fixed date, because
the Jewish 15th Nisan, unlike the dates of the Julian and
Gregorian Calendars, varied year by year. The extent
and nature of this discrepancy are caused by the Semitic
Calendar. At the commencement of the Christian
era, this Calendar was not only used by the Jews, but
also extensively followed in Syria, Arabia, Mesopotamia,
Babylon, Armenia, Osrhoëne, and in a great part of Asia
Minor, although other nationalities in these countries
kept each to its own Calendar. Thus, for example,
the Greeks in Antioch followed the Syro-Macedonian
Calendar, and so on. Where a mixed population existed
in any place, different Calendars would be found in use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>The special features of the Semitic, or Jewish Calendar,
which concern us in this connection are the following:—</p>

<p>1. The Jewish day ended at sunset, and so the evening
hours, from about six p.m. belonged to the following day.
This caused difference in dates, for what happened
according to Roman ideas at ten p.m. for example, was
regarded by the Jews as happening on the following
day.</p>

<p>2. The Jewish year was a variable lunar year, <i>i.e.</i>
it consisted of twelve months, each of which began with
the new moon, the full moon consequently falling on the
14th of each month. The moon completes her orbit
round the earth in twenty-nine and a half days, or two
orbits in fifty-nine days. The Jewish months, accordingly,
varied from twenty-nine to thirty days alternately
(Tischri and Nisan having thirty days), it
being impossible to commence a month in the middle
of a day. Thus the twelve months of the Jewish year
make up 354 days. Eleven and a quarter days were
required to make up the length of a solar year. Had
this discrepancy not been rectified in some way, every
Jewish month, and the new year as well, would, in the
course of thirty years, have made the circle of the
year. For, if in one year, the 1st Nisan coincided with
the 1st March, in the next it would fall on the 12th,
and so on.</p>

<p>The Semites brought about the necessary adjustment,
not by leap-years, but by the insertion of an additional
month. For example, eight solar years have a total of
2920 days, not counting the addition days of leap
years. The same number of days make up ninety-nine
lunar months, or, in other words, eight lunar years and
three intercalary months, are equal to eight solar years.
Thus, in eight years, three additional months must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
introduced, making the number of days almost equal
with the days of eight solar years, except for a small
discrepancy, caused by the additional day in leap year.
When these additional days had reached the number of
thirty, they could be accounted for by the introduction
of a further additional month. In regulating these
points, the equinoxes were of the utmost importance,
and, in the second place, the ceremonial oblation of the
first fruits.</p>

<p>If it was evident that the month Nisan would terminate
before the vernal equinox—its beginning and
middle had to precede the equinox, as well as the <i>quarta
decima lunæ</i>—and if the barley was not in ear by the
14th, then it was considered the discrepancy had to be
set right. This was done by prolonging the last month
of the expiring year, Adar, for twenty-nine days longer
than usual. In other words, an additional month was
added to the year, designated merely as Veadar. This
was the intercalary month. This, happening thrice in
eight years, brought the lunar and solar years into
agreement by a very simple expedient. The equinox
could be controlled by help of the Zodiac, for, on the 20th
March, the sun enters Aries, and, on the 23rd September,
Libra.</p>

<p>Had the Jews followed out this method scientifically,
<i>i.e.</i>, had the introduction of the intercalary months
followed fixed laws and been ruled by astronomical
observations and calculations, then, though still difficult,
it would have been possible to make the Jewish Calendar
synchronise with others. But the introduction of these
additional days was, so to speak, arbitrary and dependent
upon the good pleasure of the priests. Thus
we can never say for certain that such and such a year
was a leap year with the Jews, and accordingly no date<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
in the past can with certainty be made to synchronise
with a date in the Julian or any other Calendar.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Until their dispersion after the Jewish war in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
70, and even much later, the Jews reckoned their new
moons and leap years, and also the beginning of each
year, not by strictly astronomical data, but by the
method just described. The rule was that the month
began with the day on the evening of which the new
moon first became visible, and also that the passover
should be kept when the sun was in Aries.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Maimonides,
agreeing with what we have said above, informs
us that a second Adar was interposed if the vernal
equinox fell on the 16th Nisan or later. But it would
be a great mistake to think that a scientifically accurate
system, founded on these principles, was employed for
calculating the new moons and leap years, such as would
make it possible to bring the dates of the Jewish year
into certain correspondence with the Julian Calendar.
Still we must not think no attempts were made to reduce
the Calendar to order on the basis of some cyclic system,
but the caprice of the Sanhedrin always succeeded in
rendering these attempts unavailing. Ideler (i. 512)
shows how the new moons were treated, and Maimonides
tells us that the Sanhedrin was influenced by many
considerations in the choice of leap years. The Talmud
preserves a remarkable letter written by Rabbi Gamaliel,
the teacher of St Paul, to the Jews of Babylon and
Media, which may appositely be quoted here. “We
herewith inform you that we, in conjunction with our
colleagues, have deemed it necessary to add thirty
days to the year, since the doves (to be offered in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
sacrifice) are still too tender, and the lambs (for the
passover) too young, and the time of Abib (the barley
harvest) has not arrived.”</p>

<p>This passage may well serve as a warning to those
who, whenever they find a fixed date in ancient Jewish
writings, forthwith, with the aid of lunar tables, transpose
it into a date according to the Julian method of
reckoning, and possibly flatter themselves they have
found a fixed point which will form a basis for further
calculations.</p>

<p>In consequence of what we have said, it seems natural
that Jewish converts to Christianity in apostolic times
in the East should have fixed the date of Easter by
Jewish methods, without departing, in this respect,
from Jewish customs, especially as they formed the
majority in the Church. This was all the more natural
since in Syria and in many parts of Asia Minor, a Calendar
drawn up on similar principles to the Semitic, was in
use alongside the Greek (<i>i.e.</i> Roman) Calendar. This
custom, however, although retained by the Quartodecimans,
was never widespread, and did not long
survive. The principal consideration, which demanded
a departure from Jewish methods, was, that from the
Christian point of view, the Resurrection, and not the
day of Christ’s death, formed the chief feature of the
commemoration; the latter, although a day to be had in
remembrance, could not well be kept as a joyous festival.
But the Resurrection took place on the Sunday after
the 15th Nisan, and so this Sunday came to be the chief
day of the Christians’ feast.</p>

<p>Through the gradual spread of Christianity in non-Semitic
lands in the West, the necessity must soon have
arisen of fixing the day of the Resurrection by the
Julian Calendar, and of deciding according to it the day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
on which Easter had to be celebrated. But, as we have
said, it is very difficult to transfer a date from the
Jewish to the Julian Calendar, and, in most cases, quite
impossible when the date is that of an event already
long past.</p>

<p>Let us apply all this to the point in question.</p>

<p>If it was asked, “On what day did Christ die?” the
answer was, “On the 15th Nisan.” But if it was asked
again, “On which day of the Roman Calendar does the
15th Nisan fall?” the reply must be, “Who can tell?
In one year it may fall in March, in another in April;
sometimes on one day of our Calendar, sometimes on
another.”</p>

<p>The reply, “On the 15th Nisan,” conveyed nothing
either to the Romans or to the Egyptians; it was intelligible
to the Semites alone. Thus, where the Semitic
Calendar was not understood, it was necessary to fix
the day by some other method. In the choice of
methods, the Church of Alexandria, and, most of all, the
Church of Rome, took the lead. The simplest plan
would have been to discover on which day of March or
April the 15th Nisan had fallen in the year of Christ’s
death, <i>i.e.</i> 782 <span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span> But it was impossible to do this
with certainty after a few decades had elapsed. Another
starting-point had to be sought, and this was naturally
given by the spring full moon, <i>i.e.</i> the full moon nearest
to the vernal equinox, for the 15th Nisan must fall
either on this full moon or thereabouts. Thus in Rome
and Alexandria, all the principles which are in force at
the present day were gradually adopted, <i>i.e.</i> Easter is
to be celebrated on the Sunday after the full moon
following the vernal equinox. There is evidence that
this rule for determining the date of Easter was followed
in Rome from the time of Pope Sixtus I., possibly even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
earlier. The further developments do not concern us
here.</p>

<p>Here and there in the West, there was a tendency to
commemorate the death and resurrection of Christ on
fixed days in the Julian Calendar—on the 25th and 27th
of March, for example—but it never became general.
For the most part, the data for the calculation of Easter
were the same as those employed for calculating the
Jewish passover; that is to say, the full moon on the
one hand, and the vernal equinox on the other, Sunday
being introduced as an additional factor in the calculation,
since our Lord had risen on that day of the
week. In this way the above rule was established, and
so, in the date of Easter as determined at the present
day, the variable Jewish lunar year has left a trace
behind it, and, also, the connection in which Christianity
stands to Judaism receives a practical expression
deserving of being preserved to the end of time.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<h5>4. <i>The Final Settlement of the date of Easter and the
Attempts made to commemorate the day of the
Month on which Christ died</i></h5>

<p>The manner in which the commemoration of our Lord’s
passion and death admitted of being celebrated in
agreement with the Jewish Calendar, is due to the
minuteness with which the fourth Evangelist describes
the events of Holy Week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>On the 9th Nisan our Lord arrived at Bethania. The
next day, the 10th, took place the triumphal entry into
Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>—Palm Sunday.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>11th Nisan, Monday. Curse pronounced on the
barren fig-tree, and second, cleansing of the
Temple.</p>

<p>12th Nisan, Tuesday. Conferences between our Lord
and the Pharisees and Sadducees; the widow’s
mite; attempts of the Greeks to see our Lord.</p>

<p>13th Nisan, Wednesday. Judas betrays our Lord to
the Chief Priests.</p>

<p>14th Nisan, Thursday. The Last Supper and the
Betrayal.</p>

<p>15th Nisan, Friday. Condemnation and Death of
Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>16th Nisan, Sabbath. The body of Jesus in the
sepulchre.</p>

<p>17th Nisan, Sunday. The Resurrection.</p>

</div>

<p>In this way, these events could be annually commemorated
on the same days in the Jewish Calendar,
the day of the week, however, varying, as it does in the
case of the Jewish passover. That this was actually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
done is recognised by Isidore of Seville, when he says,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
“Formerly the Church kept Easter with the Jews on the
fourteenth day of moon, no matter on what day of the
week it fell.” But where the Julian, or even the
Egyptian, Calendar was in force, if a man wished to
proceed accurately in this way, without being tied down
to fixed days of the week (<i>i.e.</i> Friday for the day of
our Lord’s death, and Sunday for the Resurrection),
he would nevertheless have to learn on what day of his
own Calendar the 15th Nisan of the Jews fell in the year
of our Lord’s death. For it was quite impossible for
him to look for it at one time in March, at another time
in April, according to his own Calendar.</p>

<p>Hence arose a striking divergence at the very beginning,
which did not admit of being adjusted. Obviously,
another method for fixing the date of Easter had to be
devised for Gentile converts and for those districts where
the Julian, or, at any rate, a non-Jewish, Calendar was in
force. At the same time, it is also quite credible, because
resting on clear proof, that in Syria and Asia
Minor, the Apostles fixed the date of Easter on Quartodeciman
principles, while at Rome and Alexandria
another method obtained from the beginning. Granted
that the Roman Church, during the Apostle’s lifetime,
consisted only of converts from Judaism, still the Jews
as a whole were such a small minority in Rome that they
must have conformed to the Roman method of reckoning
time, and were probably, most of them, unfamiliar
with the Jewish Calendar. It was different in Asia
Minor where the Jews were very numerous and free to
follow their own customs, and where a Calendar closely
allied to the Jewish was used by the native population.</p>

<p>When the Christians of Asia Minor claimed for this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
practice the ordinance of the Apostles, especially St
John and St Philip,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> their appeal is as much deserving
of credit as the claim of the Romans to base <i>their</i>
practice on the ordinance of St Peter. That they
actually did so, we learn from the Festal Letters of St
Athanasius,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> who says: “The Romans lay claim to a
tradition from the Apostle Peter, forbidding to go beyond
the 26th Pharmuthi (the 21st April), on the one hand,
and the 30th Phamenoth (the 26th March), on the
other.” Here we have also the limits of the period
within which Easter at that time fell, the 25th March
being reckoned as the day of the vernal equinox.</p>

<p>The Churches which had never followed the Quartodeciman
practice, surpassed the others in number and
influence, so much the more as Egypt, where the Church
had been organised by a disciple of St Peter, and also
Greece, were among their number. When strife arose
over this point, the numerically weaker party ought
to have yielded, but rather than this, they separated
from the Catholic Church under the form of Ebionitism.
Irenæus traces the opposition of the Roman Church to
the Quartodeciman Easter back to Sixtus I. (116-125).
“The Roman Bishops,” he says according to Eusebius,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
“neither observed the Passover in this way themselves,
nor allowed those under their authority so to observe it.”
Should the thought here arise in the mind that the
Roman practice came into existence first under Sixtus,
it is contradicted by the letter of Polycrates to Pope
Victor where it is said that Rome appealed to the
Apostles Peter and Paul in support of her custom.</p>

<p>The chief reason why the Jewish Quartodeciman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
practice of the other Churches finally succumbed, was
that Christians desired to commemorate not merely the
day of our Lord’s death alone, which was linked to the
15th Nisan, but also His Resurrection. The Resurrection
had a close connection with His death in point
of time, and its commemoration was already firmly
established in apostolic times in the form of Sunday
(see above, <a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>). It was thus impossible to pass over
the Sunday, and so practically an entire week was occupied
by the commemoration. The events of Holy
Week given above could not be separated from each
other; they must be kept in connection. The Jews, as
Epiphanius<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> remarks in his polemic against the Audians,
keep their passover on a single day, while the Christians
required a whole week for their Easter commemorations.
And so, although they took the date of the
Jewish passover as the basis of their calculations,
they nevertheless did not limit the duration of their
feast to that one day. Finally, another point which
had weight, was that the Christians of the fourth century
had a fixed idea that the 14th Nisan must not fall before
the vernal equinox.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Along with this generally observed custom of commemorating
in the Church the passion and death of our
Lord, repeated attempts were made to discover and
establish a fixed date for the solemnity. Already in the
third century it was thought this had been successfully
achieved, and in Tertullian we find 782 <span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span> given as the
year of Christ’s death, and the 15th Nisan identified with
the 25th March. This date would be incorrect in any
case, even if 782 were really the year of Christ’s death,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
for in that year, the Jewish passover could only have
fallen on either the 19th March or the 17th April of the
Julian Calendar. Nevertheless the 25th March met with
no small acceptance, being accepted, amongst others,
by Hippolytus, Augustine, and Perpetuus of Tours,
who accordingly marked the 27th March in his Calendar
as the true day of the Resurrection. It appears also
in the spurious acts of Pilate. In the Carolingian period
this date constantly occurs in the martyrologies, as, for
instance, in the <i>Gellonense</i> of 804, in that of Corbie of
826, in Wandelbert of Prüm, in the different recensions
of the so-called martyrology of Jerome, and others.
Whether this day was liturgically observed, or had
merely an historic interest, cannot be decided from the
Calendars, but the former is probable.</p>

<p>Finally, it may not be without interest to observe
how in subsequent centuries attempts were made to
explain the fact that Easter, unlike other festivals, was
movable. It is conceivable that in course of time, the
true explanation, viz., the connection of the Christian
with the Jewish feast and its consequent dependence
on the Jewish Calendar, was forgotten, and attempts
began to be made to account for the fact on other
grounds, typical or otherwise.</p>

<p>After the observance had everywhere become well
established, it must have struck people that the day of
our Lord’s death was very differently commemorated
in the Church from the day of His birth, viz. as a movable
feast. Among the questions which Januarius
submitted to St Augustine, there was one bearing on this
point. Augustine<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> replied that our Lord’s birthday
was merely a commemorative festival, while Easter had
a mystical connection with the Jewish passover, as also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
its name is of Hebrew, not Greek, origin. Easter is the
fulfilment of our redemption which consists in an inward
renewal of mankind, and with this idea of renewal, the
first month of the Jewish and ancient Roman year
corresponds. Afterwards, however, Augustine forsakes
this safe path and loses himself in the symbolism of
numbers and in forced astronomical interpretations.</p>

<p>Shorter and more to the point is the explanation given
by Martin, Bishop of Dumio (561-572), who died Bishop
of Braga in 580. In his treatise <i>De Paschate</i>,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> he says
many people only add to the confusion by their unsuccessful
attempts to explain why the date of Easter is
fixed by the moon, after the Jewish custom. So, too,
the attempts recently made by many bishops of Gaul
to celebrate the Resurrection on a fixed day (the 25th
March) cannot be approved. Now the passion of
Christ is the redemption of the creature. The creation
of the world took place in Spring (c. 4), and, consequently,
the renewal of the world must also take place
in Spring, in the first month of the year. Two things
had to be taken into consideration with regard to this
festival—the day of the week and the phase of the moon.
In order to be right in both, ecclesiastical antiquity had
appointed that Easter should not be kept before the
23rd March or after the 21st April (c. 7).</p>

<p>The most important passage in this treatise bearing
upon the history of Easter is the remark that many
Gallic bishops about 570 commenced their celebration
of the festival on the 25th March as an immovable
feast. This is also confirmed by Bede,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> who had a
distinctly clearer insight into the nature of the question,
and thus expresses himself concerning the dispute about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Easter. “Originally the Apostles kept Easter on the
full moon in March, on whatever day it fell. After their
death different customs prevailed in different provinces.
The Gauls kept the festival on the 25th of March. In
Italy, some fasted twenty days, others seven, but the
Easterns remained faithful to the custom of the
Apostles.” To remedy this state of things, Pope Victor
put himself in communication with Theophilus of
Cæsarea, who held a Synod which decided that the
Resurrection should be commemorated on a Sunday,
so fixing the day of the week on which it was to be kept.</p>

<h5>5. <i>The Liturgical Celebration of Holy Week and Easter</i></h5>

<p>The Christian passover, as originally limited to Holy
Week and Easter Week, was consecrated in the first place
to the remembrances of Christ’s passion, death, and
resurrection, and to this the religious ceremonies, in
so far as they differed from the ordinary services, owed
their special character. But, in the second place, it is
to be observed that so long as the Catechumenate remained
in existence, and even to some extent afterwards,
Easter was the only season regularly appointed for
baptism. At Easter, the labours of the Catechists came
to an end, the course of preparation was finished, the
Catechumens received the sacraments of baptism, confirmation,
and the Holy Eucharist. To this fact, in the
second place, the Easter services owe much of their
special character, and even now, long after the practice
of the Church has changed, rites connected with the
administration of baptism are to be found in the ritual
of the Easter festival. Thus, the consecration of the
font on Holy Saturday, first of all, and then the consecration
of the Holy Oils on Maundy Thursday, must
be owing to the fact that they were required for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
administration of Baptism and Confirmation. On this
ground, as well as because of the importance of the feast
in itself, it is obvious that Easter, from the liturgical
point of view, is conspicuous among all the other
festivals, and that a number of rites are then performed
which are not repeated in the course of the whole year.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>To these rites belong the reading of the Passion on
Palm Sunday, and on the Tuesday and Wednesday in
Holy Week, the procession on Palm Sunday, the Consecration
of the Holy Oils on Maundy Thursday, the
<i>missa præsanctificatorum</i> on Good Friday. More than
the others, Holy Saturday is conspicuous for a number
of rites peculiar to itself, viz.:—</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>1. The blessing of the fire from which the other lights
in the Church are lit, and the blessing of the five
grains of incense for the pascal candle: both
ceremonies being performed outside before the
door of the Church.</p>

<p>2. The procession thence into the Church.</p>

<p>3. The blessing of the pascal candle by the singing of
the <i>Exsultet</i> or <i>præconium paschale</i>.</p>

<p>4. The reading of the prophecies from the Old
Testament.</p>

<p>5. The blessing of the baptismal font, in which the
pascal candle is employed.</p>

<p>6. The baptism of catechumens, if there are any.</p>

<p>7. The chanting of the Litany of the Saints during the
<i>humi prostratio</i>.</p>

<p>8. The mass of Holy Saturday without introit, and
with the threefold Alleluia, <i>i.e.</i>, instead of
Vespers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>9. In many places Easter festivities take place on the
evening of Holy Saturday, but these are not
liturgical.</p>

<p>10. On Easter morning, the lifting up of the Crucifix
from the sepulchre; procession, opening of the
doors, and entry into the church. The gospel
being St Mark xvi. 1-7.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Middle Ages other special ceremonies and forms
of rejoicing took place.</p>

<p>That Easter was the special season for the baptism of
those catechumens whose preparation had extended over
the whole of the preceding year, is made prominent
only at a comparatively later date, in special laws, when
the catechumenate was already dying out, as, for
example, in the seventh canon of the Roman Synod of
402, the fourth Canon of Gerunda, the eighteenth Canon
of Auxerre, where it is expressly laid down that outside
the Easter season, baptism must be given to none save
the sick. By the time of the Second Synod of Maçon
(585), the custom of baptising all the year round on any
day had already become very common. This Synod,
however, endeavoured to reinstate the ancient custom
and also prescribed rest from work for the whole Easter
week.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> However, as late as the seventh and eighth
centuries, Easter continued to be the regular season for
baptism, at least in Rome, as the so-called scrutinies<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
show, and even the Synod of Neuching (772), in its
eighteenth canon, wished to restrict baptism to only
two dates in the year.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>At an early date, Holy Week had already received
a special name, <i>septimana major</i>, which appears already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
in the fourth century,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and which it still retains in
liturgical books. The German name (Karwoche) comes
from the old German <i>chara</i> or <i>kara</i>, sadness or lamentation,
and served to mark the character of the time,
always and everywhere regarded in the Church as a time
of sadness.</p>

<p>The description of the liturgical ceremonies of Holy
Week is best introduced by the account of a pilgrim
from Gaul in the fourth century. To the account of her
travels, written between 383 and 394, at the end of a
pilgrimage extending over three years, she added a
description of all that took place during Holy Week in
Jerusalem at that period. There, the Holy places themselves
suggested devotional practices which were imitated
throughout the Church, and have partially survived to
the present day, as, for example, the procession of
palms and the <i>adoratio crucis</i>. Liturgical scholars,
being ignorant of this source of information, formerly
sought the origin of these practices in a wrong quarter: it
is now beyond doubt that they originated in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>To begin with, students of the liturgy used to be
divided over the question when and where the palm
procession originated, and various conjectures were put
forth. Binterim thought Bishop Peter introduced the
blessing of palms at Edessa in 397, while Martène,
attributed its origin to the eighth or ninth century.
As a matter of fact, not a trace of the blessing of palms
is found in the Gregorian sacramentary.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> We shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
certainly not be mistaken if we look for the origin of the
palm procession in Jerusalem, for the Gallic pilgrim
gives us the following account: On the Sunday, at the
beginning of Holy Week, the usual Sunday morning
services were held in the larger church on Golgotha,
then called the <i>Martyrium</i>, but at the seventh hour of
the day (about one <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>) all the people assembled on the
Mount of Olives, where was the cave in which the Lord
used to teach. There for two hours, hymns and antiphons
were sung and lections from the Scriptures were
read. At the ninth hour, they ascended to the summit,
whence the Lord ascended to heaven. Here again,
hymns were sung, lections suitable to the place and day
were read, and prayers were offered up. At the seventh
hour, when the gospel account of Christ’s entry into
Jerusalem had been read, all rose up, and with branches
of palm or olive in their hands, and, singing <i>Benedictus
qui venit</i>, proceeded from the hill down into the city, and
continued their procession until they reached the Church
of the Anastasis where vespers were sung, and an <i>oratio
ad crucem</i> offered up.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>It was quite in keeping with the dramatic character
of Catholic worship to represent, in some marked way,
Christ’s memorable entry into Jerusalem at the last
passover. On the very scene of the event especially,
one was, so to speak, drawn on to do so without any
special exercise of the inventive faculty being required.</p>

<p>However, we must follow the pilgrim’s description to
the end. On Tuesday, there was another procession to
the Mount of Olives, where the Bishop read the gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
St Mark xxv. 3 <i>et seqq.</i> On Wednesday, the account of
the treason of Judas was read as the gospel, and during
it, the people wept and lamented. On Maundy
Thursday, the psalmody began at cock-crow; at four
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> mass was said in the <i>Martyrium</i> by the Bishop, at
which the people communicated. Towards seven
o’clock in the evening, the people assembled in the
Eleona, as the church which then stood on the Mount of
Olives was called, and, towards eleven o’clock, ascended
to the summit of the mount, praying and singing. This
lasted until cock-crow the following day. Then, about
three <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the assembly broke up and a start was made for
the Garden of Gethsemani, where they found the beautiful
church lit up by two hundred lamps. Here the bishop
said a prayer; a suitable psalm followed, and then the
reading of the gospel, St Matt. xxvi. 41 <i>et seqq.</i>, which
narrates the capture of Christ in Gethsemani. Then the
procession slowly descended the mount into the city,
and passed on until it reached the place of the crucifixion.
Here the gospel narrative of Christ’s trial was
read: the bishop addressed the people and dismissed
them with an exhortation to return about seven o’clock,
for the adoration of the Holy Cross. Whereupon, the
people proceeded to Mount Sion to pray at the column
of the flagellation, and then returned to their
homes.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock, the bishop took his seat on his
throne in the chapel of the Holy Cross. Before him
was placed a table covered with a white linen cloth, round
which the deacons took up their position. Then the
silver shrine containing the wood of the Holy Cross was
brought in. It was opened and the Holy Cross itself,
along with the inscription (<i>titulus</i>) laid upon the table.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
The faithful and catechumens approached, knelt, kissed
the Cross, and touched it with their forehead and eyes,
but not with their hands. In this way, they passed by,
one by one, while the deacons kept watch. Then the
deacons exhibited also to the people Solomon’s ring and
the horn with which the Jewish kings used to be
anointed: these also were kissed.</p>

<p>At the sixth hour, noon, the service proceeded in the
following manner. The people assembled in the open
court between the chapel of the Holy Cross and the
Church of the Anastasis; the bishop took his seat on
the throne, and then lections from the Scriptures were
read continuously, until the ninth hour. These related
to the passion, and were taken from the Old Testament,
from the psalms and prophets, as well as from the New
Testament. At the ninth hour, the passage from St
John xix. 30, which speaks of the death of Jesus, was
read and the assembly was dismissed. The service was
then immediately resumed in the chief church (the
<i>Martyrium</i>), and continued until the reading of the
passage (St John xix. 38), describing the descent from
the Cross, and then again a prayer was recited and the
blessing of the catechumens took place. With this, the
service for the day concluded and the people were
dismissed. The younger clerics, however, remained
throughout the night watching in the church.</p>

<p>With regard to the liturgy for Good Friday, the
pilgrim found that the ceremonies she saw in Jerusalem
differed not at all from what she was familiar with in her
own country. She only observes that the baptised
children were conducted by the bishop first to the
Church of the Resurrection and then to the principal
church (the <i>Martyrium</i>).<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>This is the earliest complete description of the ceremonies
of Holy Week which we possess. We now pass
to the usages of a later date.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Palm Sunday</span></h6>

<p>The Sunday next before Easter is commonly called
Palm Sunday (<i>Dominica in ramis palmarum</i>, Gr. κυριακὴ
τῶν βαΐον). At an earlier date it was also called
<i>Dominica competentium</i>, because on it catechumens
requested baptism. In some sacramentaries it is called
<i>in capitilavio</i>,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> from the washing and shaving of the head
in preparation for baptism.</p>

<p>Among the characteristic ceremonies of this day, is
the procession, at which branches of palm, or of some
other similar tree, are carried. In the Middle Ages, this
was fairly common; not so, however, the blessing of the
palms.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> In the Roman ritual, this blessing is performed
with much ceremony. It resembles in form the <i>ordo
missæ</i>, consisting of an introit, collect, epistle, gospel,
another prayer and a preface, followed by the actual
blessing comprising five more prayers, sprinkling with
holy water and incensation. Upon this, the procession
starts, which passes out of the church, the doors of
which are then closed. They are reopened when the
deacon has knocked with the staff of the processional
cross, and the procession enters, recalling the entry of
our Lord through the gates of Jerusalem. In the Mass
which follows, the Passion according to St Matthew is
read or sung.</p>

<p>In the oldest Roman sacramentaries, however, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
is found relating to the blessing and procession of
palms, but the ritual for them is minutely described
in the Ordos, xii. c. 9 (of Cencio Savelli), and xv.
c. 53 <i>et seq.</i> These clearly belong to the Middle Ages.
The first trace of the practice of holding palm-branches
during divine service, as far as the rituals of the Roman
Church are concerned, is found in the later recension of
the Gregorian sacramentary used in Gaul in the ninth
and tenth centuries. Among the prayers for the day
is found one for the blessing, not of the palms, but of
those who carried them. In the Gelasian and Gregorian
sacramentaries, the Sunday is at any rate called <i>Dominica
in Palmas</i>, but only in the title. It seems as if
people were satisfied at first with holding palms during
the Mass, and that the palm procession only took shape
later. In the Gotho-Gallican missal, the Sunday has no
special name and no mention is made of palms. On
the other hand, the name appears in the lectionaries
of Silos and Luxeuil. Everything points to the blessing
of the palms, and, probably, also the procession, having
become customary in the second half of the ninth
century.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Isidore of Seville<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> is familiar with the name
<i>dies palmarum</i>, but not with the procession. Amalarius,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
on the contrary, mentions the custom of carrying palm
branches through the church and of shouting Hosanna.</p>

<p>There was, however, a rite, universally observed on
Palm Sunday, which had reference to the administration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
of baptism. As is well known, the catechumens in
primitive times were instructed in Christian doctrine
during Lent, and even for a longer period. The instruction
of catechumens and the solemn administration of
baptism took place only once a year. The former
began eight weeks before Easter, and ended with the
baptism which was administered on Easter Eve. The
concluding part of this course of instruction was composed
of the so-called mystagogical instructions treating
of the sacrifice of the Mass, and the three sacraments of
baptism, confirmation, and the Holy Eucharist. The
words of the Creed, so the <i>disciplina arcani</i> enjoined,
were the last, not the first thing to be imparted. The
catechumens learnt the Creed for the first time on Palm
Sunday. This was the custom in Spain,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Milan,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
probably also in Rome. There seems, however, to have
been divergences as to the choice of the day, for it was
necessary, at any rate in Gaul, to enjoin uniformity,
since the Synod of Agde (506) prescribes in its thirteenth
canon: In every diocese, the Creed shall be imparted in
church to the catechumens on one and the same day,
<i>i.e.</i> eight days before Easter Sunday. This ceremony
was called the <i>traditio symboli</i>.</p>

<p>The manner in which this was done is fully described
in the Gelasian sacramentary, although at that date the
catechumenate, strictly speaking, no longer existed.
After some introductory remarks from the priest, an
acolyte rehearsed the Creed to the candidates for
baptism, who were exhorted to impress it on their minds
and hearts.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The rite, at all events, was the same as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
in earlier times. In the Gregorian sacramentary these
practices are already omitted. A similar practice was
followed with regard to the Our Father. It was first
taught <i>verbatim</i> to the baptised after their baptism.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
This ceremony formed the chief characteristic of the
Sunday next before Easter, in service-books in which
the name Palm Sunday was as yet unknown. Accordingly,
in the Gallican missal the Mass for the day is
called, <i>Missa in Traditio Symboli</i>.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages, in various places, and
especially in Germany, Christ’s entry into Jerusalem
was represented in a somewhat naïve manner by carrying
round in the procession a wooden figure representing the
Saviour seated on an ass. Afterwards it was brought
into the Church and placed in a conspicuous position.
While suitable hymns were being sung, the clergy and
people venerated it on their knees, and there it remained
for the rest of the day. Figures of the so-called
“Palmesel” are still numerous in museums, as, for
example, at Basel, Zurich, Munich, Nürnberg, etc.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Maundy Thursday</span></h6>

<p>The fifth day of Holy Week, the day on which Christ
partook of the last Passover with His disciples and
instituted the memorial of His Passion, is generally
called <i>Cœna Domini</i> in service-books. The Greeks,
however, call it merely ἡ ἁγία καὶ μεγάλη πέμπτη, the
Great and Holy Thursday.</p>

<p>In the Calendar of Polemius Silvius is found, under the
24th March, the remarkable note <i>Natalis Calicis</i>. This
is owing to the fact that at that period the 25th March
was regarded as the day of Christ’s death, and the 27th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
as the day of His resurrection. The day of the institution
of the Holy Eucharist and of the Sacrifice of
the Mass was not passed over in even such an imperfect
list of the Church’s festivals as that contained in this
Calendar. The day had something of a festival character
belonging to itself. Indeed, among the Copts it appears
as a regular festival.</p>

<p>The name <i>Natalis Calicis</i> seems to have been common
in southern and western Gaul, for it is found in Avitus
of Vienne, and in Eligius of Noyon, in the sixth and
seventh centuries. The same writers mark the day as a
festival, <i>sollemnitas</i>, on which those who had been put
to public penance were everywhere received back into
the Church, and on which the Chrism was consecrated.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The most unlikely of the many attempts to explain
the German name for the day is that which connects
it with St Luke xxiii. 31, and makes the name,
Green Thursday, signify that the withered branches,
sinners, by their reception again into the bosom of the
Church once more grow green.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Apart from the
fact that this interpretation is far-fetched, it savours
too much of the study to have ever given rise to
the name among the common people. The fact is
that red vestments were worn at the reception of the
penitents on Maundy Thursday, but green vestments at
the Mass, and this gave rise to the name.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The older
service-books, however, drawn up before liturgical
colours had been introduced and their use had become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
regulated, do not specify the colour for the vestments,
but content themselves with prescribing the use of
festal vestments (<i>vestes sollemniores</i>) in general. Later
on, the Roman custom of wearing white vestments on
this day became general.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>It was only to be expected that the Church should
keep with special solemnity the day on which Christ
had celebrated the last passover with His apostles,
and had instituted the mystery of His Body and Blood.
In fact, Holy Saturday alone of the days of Holy
Week can vie with it in this respect. It frequently
ranks as a Church festival, and is expressly called a
<i>sollemnitas</i>.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The ritual directions for Maundy Thursday, of which
we possess a considerable number dating from the Middle
Ages, naturally begin with the Psalmody. This began
at midnight, and its distinguishing feature was, that the
lights lit at its commencement did not remain burning,
but were extinguished, one at a time, after each psalm,
until, at the concluding prayers, the church was in total
darkness. The number of candles varied in different
places, between fifteen, twenty-four, thirty, and thirty-four.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Such was the “dark mattins,” <i>tenebræ</i>.</p>

<p>The second characteristic ceremony of the day was
the reconciliation of the penitents. These had to remain
prostrate on the ground while the Miserere and other
prayers were recited over them and their absolution
pronounced. On this occasion, as we have remarked
above, red vestments were worn. The reconciled penitents
were admitted to communion with the rest of the
congregation at the Mass which followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>This Mass was of a festal character, and, in many
places, in primitive times, two Masses were celebrated,
one at the usual hour in the morning, and the other
towards evening at the time of vespers. In other places,
on the contrary, there was only one Mass, at which all
the faithful communicated.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> These different customs
in course of time became a cause of astonishment and
offence, and so Bishop Januarius enquired of St Augustine
what ought to be done. The reply was, that each ought
to follow the custom of his own diocese. In Rome also,
at the period when the Gelasian sacramentary was in
use, two Masses were still celebrated, for the sacramentary
gives a <i>Missa ad Vesperum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The same
authority notices only the reconciliation of penitents
and the consecration of the Holy Oils among the other
ceremonies performed on Maundy Thursday. The
Gregorian sacramentary gives only the latter, as also
does Ordo I., the earliest of the sixteen ancient Roman
ordos.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> In liturgical writings relating to our subject
which belong to the Middle Ages, especially in the pseudo-Alcuin,
the consecration of the Holy Oils is given at
considerable length.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> St Cyprian had already spoken
of the consecration of oil required for ritual purposes
without saying on what day it took place.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>At the conclusion of the Mass, the altar was washed
by the bishop or officiating priest, and, in the afternoon,
the washing of the feet was performed, at which the
Superior washed the feet of his subjects, or the bishop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
the feet of twelve old men representing the twelve
apostles. In the Middle Ages, the usual name for this
ceremony was <i>Mandatum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The washing of the altar
and the consecration of the Chrism is spoken of by
Isidore of Seville.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In the later Middle Ages, to these
ceremonies was added the reading of the Bull in <i>Cœna
Domini</i>, containing a list of errors condemned by the
Church under pain of excommunication. The reading
of this Bull continued from the fourteenth to the end of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Finally, in some countries, the public ceremonial
recitation of the Creed by the catechumens (<i>redditio
symboli</i>) was prescribed for Maundy Thursday, as by
the forty-sixth canon of the Synod of Laodicea, and
by the sixty-eighth Trullan canon. This, however, in
Rome, was done on Holy Saturday by each person in
turn from some conspicuous place in the church.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Good Friday</span></h6>

<p>The day of our Lord’s Passion was universally regarded
as a day of mourning—“<i>dies amaritudinis</i>,” St
Ambrose calls it, “on which we fast.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> A fast day, on
liturgical principles, can never be a festival, though,
<i>vice versâ</i>, a festival can fall on a fixed day of fasting
or abstinence, as, for example, the Annunciation.</p>

<p>When, at an early date, the Roman emperor made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
a law forbidding the Courts to sit on Good Friday,
this did not make it a festival. On the contrary, the
Church Order of the period of Constantine expressly
declares that “both it and Holy Saturday are days of
sorrow, and not feasts.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Accordingly, there was
enjoined upon all whose health enabled them to observe
it, an unbroken fast lasting over the two days, directly
based upon St Mark ii. 20. For, as the eighth canon of
the fourth Synod of Toledo says, “The whole Church is
wont to spend Good Friday in fasting and sorrow, on
account of our Lord’s Passion.” There is scarcely any
other point on which such liturgical agreement exists in
all lands and in all periods of Christian antiquity as on
this. The above-named Synod mentions with reprobation
a mistaken expression of grief, <i>i.e.</i> in many places
the churches were shut up for the whole day, and no
services, neither divine office nor sermon, were held
(seventh canon). The Synod does not blame the
omission of Mass, for this was universal. This sentiment
of sorrow was outwardly manifested, after the introduction
of liturgical colours, by the fact that on Good
Friday, black vestments were worn.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In the Middle
Ages, discussion arose over the question why the days
of the saints’ deaths were kept as festivals, but Good
Friday as a day of mourning. The monk Helperich, who
lived at St Gall at the end of the ninth century, replied;
Christ, unlike the saints, attained to no higher degree
of glory through His death. He died not for His
own sake but for us. The Jews, His enemies, rejoiced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
over His death, but the apostles bewailed and
lamented.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>It may be observed here that in Würtemburg,
Mecklenburg, Saxony, Reuss ä. L., Altenburg, and Lippe,
Good Friday is one of the days of penitence and prayer,
but, on the other hand, wherever Calvinism is in the
ascendent, the dogmatic significant of the day, as the day
of our redemption has been partially changed. There it
ranks as a Church festival, and in other respects is given
up to excursions and entertainments, just as if someone
would pass the day of his father’s death in rejoicings,
because a rich inheritance had fallen to him.</p>

<p>The Good Friday services began at night with mattins,
at which the lights were extinguished in the same manner
as on the previous day. In addition, the low tone in
which the devotions were pitched, and the omission of the
<i>Gloria Patri</i> at the end of the psalms, gave outward
expression to the sentiment of sorrow.</p>

<p>The liturgy proper to Good Friday, according to the
rite now in use, begins with the prostration (<i>humi
prostratio</i>) of the celebrant on the steps of the altar.
Then, without their title being given out, follow lections
from the prophets, in which the death of the Messias
and its virtue were foretold. These sufferings themselves
are described in the words of the Passion according
to St John, which are said or sung immediately
afterwards. Then follow the general intercessions, at
the conclusion of which, the Host, consecrated on the
previous day, is brought to the altar from the place
where it has been reserved. The paternoster is then sung
followed by the elevation of the Host and the communion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
of the celebrant. This <i>missa præsanctificatorum</i>
is nothing more than an elaborate rite of communion.
It is preceded by the <i>Adoratio Crucis</i>, and followed by
the laying of the Cross in the sepulchre, which dates
from about the tenth century.</p>

<p>At an earlier period, the ceremonies were simpler,
and even restricted to psalmody, for Innocent I., says,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
that in his time, generally speaking, Mass was not celebrated
on Good Friday and Holy Saturday. This is
still the custom among the Greeks and Russians. Their
Good Friday service consists of the singing of psalms
and the veneration of a representation of our Lord on
the Cross, similar to our <i>adoratio crucis</i>. At the evening
service, that is, a painted, not carved, representation of
the dead Christ is brought in and venerated.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> These
expressions must be taken quite literally, in the sense
that on Good Friday not even the <i>missa præsanctificatorum</i>
was celebrated, nor the now usual Mass on the
morning of Holy Saturday. For the Gelasian sacramentary
gives no Mass for either of these days but only
the various prayers, so too the old Gallic missal,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and
the same must be understood when we hear of the
Churches in parts of Spain not being opened on Good
Friday. Sermons, however, were preached on Good
Friday, for we possess several of Leo I., and Gregory
the Great preached on this day. It is difficult to say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
what was the custom as to Holy Communion. In
France, the people seem to have communicated, but not
in Rome or in Germany; at least Rabanus Maurus is
silent on the point.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>According to the evidence afforded by the ancient
service-books, it may be conjectured that the adoption
of the <i>missa præsanctificatorum</i>, as well as the striking
insertion of the Greek passages in the Reproaches, is due
to Greek influence. That alterations were made at a
considerably later date in these parts of the rite will
be noticed elsewhere.</p>

<p>With regard to the service-books of the Roman
Church in particular, we find a rubric in the Gelasian
sacramentary, directing that the Holy Cross be placed
on the altar, and then that the priests and attendant
clerics take their position at the altar in silence and
begin the solemn intercessions for the whole Church, for
all estates of men, etc.; the intercessions being prefaced
by the summons to kneel (<i>flectamus genua</i>). The genuflection
seems at that time to have been made also
before the prayer for the Jews, for the rubric directs the
deacon to proceed “<i>ut supra</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The prayers are the well-known
Good Friday prayers. There is no mention at
this point of the <i>Adoratio Crucis</i>, but at the conclusion of
the intercessions, the sacred Species, in both kinds, which
had been consecrated the previous day were brought
from the sacrarium by the deacons and placed on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
altar. The priest consumed them, having first adored
and kissed the Cross. Whereupon all present adored the
Cross and communicated. It must not be forgotten, in
this connection, that the Gelasian sacramentary does
not represent the Roman rite in its purity, but embellished
with numerous Gallican additions, which
probably owe their origin to Alcuin or his contemporaries.
The same is true of the edition of the Gregorian
sacramentary employed in France.</p>

<p>In this last we find the general intercessions recurring
twice in Holy Week, on Wednesday and again on Good
Friday,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> but they are not placed at the beginning of the
liturgy, as they are in the Gelasian sacramentary.
After the bishop has taken his seat, the tract, <i>Domine
audivi</i>, a lection from the Scriptures, and then another
tract followed in succession. The Passion according to
St John came next, and then the prayers in question.
At their conclusion the altar was stripped. The solemn
adoration of the Cross before the altar by clergy and
people took place at the time of vespers, and, during it,
the antiphon, <i>Ecce lignum crucis</i>, was sung. The <i>missa
præsanctificatorum</i> proceeded in essentially the same
manner as at present, except that the elevation is
not expressly mentioned. The altar remained bare
from the afternoon of Maundy Thursday until Good
Friday morning. The Gregorian sacramentary in its
original form knew nothing of these rites. It proscribed
nothing more for Good Friday than the nine prayers
still in use and a blessing of the catechumens.</p>

<p>A full description of the whole ritual for Holy Week
is to be found in the first of the ancient Roman Ordos
edited by Mabillon, which gives both the psalmody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
and the special ceremonies. Mabillon attributes this
ordo to the ninth century.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> According to it, the
psalmody began at midnight. As on the previous day,
the candles were gradually extinguished, and the sad
character of the service was indicated by the low tone
taken for the prayers and by the omission of the <i>Gloria
Patri</i>. The consecrated Host was brought back from
the place where it had been reserved the day before,
and the <i>missa præsanctificatorum</i> commenced. This
consisted of preface, Our Father, the prayer <i>Libera me</i>,
the pax, and communion of the people. This last is
omitted from the existing Roman rite. The adoration
of the Cross preceded the Mass, as at present. In
monasteries a procession took place within the cloister.
The ceremonies of the Mass here described agree
in all essential points with the Frankish edition of the
Gregorian sacramentary, as, for instance, in the recitation
of the <i>orationes sollemnes</i> on both Wednesday and
Good Friday. Thus the earlier liturgical services
for Good Friday were replaced in the ninth century
by an elaborate ritual, which agrees in all important
respects with that in use at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Holy Saturday</span></h6>

<p>This too is a day of mourning, as appears also from
the fact that, in the Eastern Church, it is numbered
among the fast days, although originally in the East
no Saturday was kept as a fast. But the sadness of
the day is already modified by the approach of the
Resurrection, and the Alleluia, which has not been
heard since Septuagesima, is sung again at the Mass.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>The solemnity begins, as on the preceding days,
with the night office, at which the lights are again
extinguished. This custom is very ancient, but the
use of the triangle with the <i>lumen Christi</i> is of later
introduction.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Mediæval writers begin their description of the other
ceremonies with the blessing of the fire, which, even then,
was performed early in the morning. Concerning the
origin of this rite, it has been held that it took place
not only on Holy Saturday, but every evening at
Vespers.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Still the evidence for this is not sufficiently
strong, and, on the other hand, this rite harmonises
in an especial way with Holy Saturday as the appointed
date for the administration of baptism, for which a
favourite name was illumination (<i>illuminatio</i>, φωτισμός).
The name <i>illuminandi</i> was common also for those
about to be baptised.</p>

<p>To the same association of ideas, the Paschal candle
certainly owes its origin. It is not yet clear where we
are to look for the origin of this custom. In Spain, there
is evidence to show that the blessing of a candle or
lamp (<i>lucerna</i>) on Easter night was common. The
fourth synod of Toledo (633), in its ninth canon,
recommends the adoption of this practice to the churches
of Galicia. The Paschal candle is a symbol of Christ,
and is blessed through the chanting of the <i>præconium
paschale</i> or <i>Exsultet</i>, a grand song of triumph, said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
have been composed by St Augustine. This candle,
placed in its own candlestick near the altar, is lit at
High Mass throughout Eastertide. Two prefaces for
its blessing are found in the writings of Bishop Ennodius
of Pavia († 521), and mediæval liturgical writers generally
attribute the blessing of the Paschal candle to Pope
Zosimus.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>At an earlier period, the special ceremonies of Holy
Saturday commenced in the afternoon, the forenoon
being devoted to decorating the church and preparing
for the festival.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> These ceremonies are, the blessing of
the Paschal candle, the lections from the Old Testament,
and the blessing of the baptismal font, all of which are
only preparatory to the solemn administration of
baptism. As has been said, these ceremonies only
commenced towards evening and continued into the
night, which was observed as a vigil (<i>pervigilium
paschale</i>). When they were concluded, the neophytes
were baptised, and then, also in the night, followed the
Mass of the day. To this the newly baptised, along
with the people and clergy, proceeded in a solemn
procession from the baptistery, when there was one,
to the principal church. The Emperor Constantine
allowed the streets and squares of the capital to be
illuminated on this night. He himself as a catechumen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
passed the night in prayer in his private chapel, and
hallowed the Easter festival by the bestowal of rich
alms. The Mass is entitled in the service-books, <i>in
vigilia paschæ</i>. Since it came after midnight, the
Alleluia could be sung at it. This arrangement as regards
the time of the Mass still held good in the eleventh
century, for Rupert of Deutz (<i>De div. Off.</i>, 7, 11) still
speaks of it as being the established practice, and only
later on were the above-mentioned ceremonies and the
Mass transferred to the afternoon of Saturday, the
Alleluia thus coming before its time. Upon this
followed the psalmody of Easter, which had to be made
as short as possible on account of the length of these
ceremonies. Sermons also were usually short at Easter,
for the same reason.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>In the early centuries, the Roman rite was much
simpler. The festival commenced with the recitation
of the creed by the candidates for baptism and a prayer
by the Pope over them. Then followed the other
preparations for baptism, the renunciations, four lessons
from the Old Testament, the singing of Psalm xli., two
prayers, the blessing of the baptismal water, the
baptism itself, and the confirmation of the baptised.
The Mass concluded the function.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>We must now see what special features the other
liturgical documents contained. In the <i>missale Gallicanum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
we find, after the prayers for each of the hours,
the <i>Exsultet</i>, and the blessing of the Paschal candle, then
the general intercessions for all estates of Christian men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
concluding with intercessions for the neophytes and
<i>competentes</i>. Upon this follows the baptismal rite
(<i>opus ad baptizandum</i>), viz., the exorcisms, the blessing
of the baptismal water, the washing of the feet, and
the baptism itself. Then come the prayers for the Mass.
The rite in the <i>Missale Gothico-Gallicanum</i> is exactly
the same.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The Gelasian sacramentary prescribes the following
rite for Holy Saturday: Early in the morning, the
exorcisms shall be made over the catechumens, and,
after they have made their solemn renunciations,
they shall repeat the creed (<i>redditio symboli</i>). About the
eighth hour, the clergy shall assemble in the <i>sacrarium</i>,
commence the litanies there, and proceed to the altar;
at the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, the Paschal candle is to be lighted
and blessed, but without the chanting of the <i>Exsultet</i>.
Then the lections from the Old Testament are read,
each with a prayer, and after them takes place the
blessing of the font and the baptism of the neophytes.</p>

<p>According to the edition of the Gregorian sacramentary
used in France, the clergy and people assemble
in the church about the eighth hour, <i>i.e.</i> about 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
according to present reckoning. Two candles were then
lit, which were held by notaries, one on the right, the
other on the left of the altar; while a lector from the
pulpit read the Old Testament lections, each of which
concluded with a prayer. Thereupon the clergy and
the bishop proceeded in procession, the notaries with
the candles leading the way, to the baptistery, where
the baptismal water was blessed. After the blessing
of the water, which was the same as that now in use,
the baptism followed, at which it is to be observed a
distinction is made between children and those who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
grown up. The former were confirmed also immediately
after baptism, the ritual and significance of confirmation
being here clearly shown.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> After the baptism, the
litanies are sung in the church by singers, who then
intoned the <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>. The Mass of the day
brought the function to a close.</p>

<p>Just as the Church marked the anniversary of the
dedication of a church and of ordination by a special
festival, so was the anniversary of their baptism a day
of joy and thanksgiving for the baptised. It was also
a day for renewing their baptismal vows, and for
serious self-examination. The Church provided for
this inasmuch as she was accustomed to celebrate this
anniversary, and appointed a special Mass for it. It
was called the <i>pascha annotina</i>.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> A festival of this
nature had a <i>raison d’être</i> only so long as it was customary
to baptise people when they were grown up. When
it became general to baptise little children immediately
after their birth, this festival fell out of use. The
<i>pascha annotina</i>, however, appears in the <i>Homilarium</i>
compiled by Paul the Deacon by command of Charlemagne,
about 785-90, and in the Sacramentary of
Essen, composed between 850 and 874.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Easter and the Easter Octave</span></h6>

<p>If one wishes to form a correct idea of the festival
of Easter, one must always bear in mind its close connection
with the solemn administration of baptism.
The preliminary ceremonies began on Saturday afternoon
and lasted throughout the night. When the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
to be baptised was very large, the administration of
baptism and the Easter festival could be combined.
This connection was lost at only quite a late date, in
days when all remembrance of the grounds for it had died
out, and people had no longer any idea of the catechumenate.
The chief and most striking ceremonies were
then transferred to the forenoon, and it is much to be
regretted that, in those centuries, no creative force was
forthcoming to form something in keeping with the
altered conditions of the time. Owing to the alteration
in the hour, many of the ceremonies are rendered
meaningless.</p>

<p>The interval thus produced was occupied by the
festival commemoration of the Resurrection, and by
a great procession. The latter can easily be traced
back to the solemn procession of the catechumens and
clergy from the baptistery to the cathedral, which took
place in primitive times after baptism. It was probably
ignorance of this custom which led later writers
to trace the origin of this procession to the words of
Christ to His disciples: “I will go before you into
Galilee” (St Matt. xxvi. 32; xxviii. 16),<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> directing
them to go to Galilee after His resurrection.</p>

<p>The Easter ceremonies varied in different countries
and in different dioceses. The earliest mention of them
appears in the <i>Ordo Romanus</i> belonging to the thirteenth
century which goes by the name of Cardinal James
Cajetan.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> It would lead us too far from our subject
to describe them and the other customs formerly
observed on Easter Day; besides, such special points of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
ritual are better dealt with in connection with the liturgy
itself. We shall here only mention the blessing of
food, especially those kinds of food which, after having
been forbidden in Lent, again become lawful, such as
flesh meat in particular, eggs, cheese, butter, and other
things as well. The original object of this blessing
of food was plainly to check the tendency to over-indulgence
which might assert itself after a prolonged
period of self-denial.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>We must now return to the account of the Gallic
pilgrim. She speaks of processions to the different
churches and to the Mount of Olives as having taken
place in Jerusalem not only on Easter Day, but on the
other days of the octave as well. She finds no other
points to notice in which the customs at Jerusalem
differed from those observed at her own home. On
the Saturday and Sunday after Easter, the narrative
of St Thomas’s unbelief formed the Gospel, as at the
present day.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the Easter octave, the two first days
rank as festivals of the first class. On Monday, the
supper at Emmaus is commemorated, the Gospel being
St Luke xxiv. 13-35; on Tuesday, the appearance of
our Lord and His apostles, narrated in St Luke xxiv.
36-47; on Wednesday, His appearance by the Sea of
Tiberias to Peter and the others, as they were fishing,
St John xxi. 1-14; on Thursday, His appearance in the
garden to Mary Magdalen, St John xx. 11-18; on
Friday, His appearance on the mountain in Galilee,
St Matt. xxviii. 16-20; on Saturday, the Gospel contains
the account of the first appearance of Jesus to Mary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
Magdalen immediately after His resurrection, St John
xx. 1-9.</p>

<p>The following Sunday forms the conclusion of the
Easter octave, and, accordingly, was formerly called
simply <i>octava paschæ</i>, or <i>pascha clausum</i>, later it was
called White Sunday, <i>dominica in albis</i>, <i>scil.</i> <i>deponendis</i>,
because the neophytes wore their white baptismal
garments until this day. When Easter ceased to be
the day for baptisms, it was appointed, as being in
harmony with White Sunday, that children should
receive their first communion, and renew their baptismal
vows. Rabanus Maurus<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> further observes that in his
time confirmation was given on White Sunday. The
prayers during the Easter octave contain references
to the two great sources of festal gladness, the resurrection
of our Lord and the increase in the number of the
faithful. The prayers for the third, fifth, and sixth
ferias are specially concerned with the latter, while the
Gospels throughout are occupied with the appearances
of our Lord after His resurrection to His disciples. The
Epistles, however, are either for the most part taken
from the Acts, or describe that spiritual renewal of
mankind which follows upon the work of redemption.
The prayers for the whole octave, with the exception
of two on Monday, are the same at the present day as
those in the Gregorian sacramentary.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> For the following
Sundays, until Whitsunday, they only occasionally agree
with the prayers of this sacramentary, being taken
bodily, with two unimportant exceptions, from the
Gelasian. The Sundays lead up to the fulfilment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Christ’s redemptive work and His return to the Father.
The Gospels from the third to the fifth are accordingly
taken from the sixteenth chapter of St John.</p>

<p>Right in the middle of the period anciently called
<i>quinquagesima</i>, that is to say on the twenty-fifth day
after Easter, or, in other words, on the Wednesday of
the fourth week after Easter, the event recorded in St
John vii. 1 was formerly commemorated in certain
churches. In the midst of the feast of Tabernacles,
Christ went up into the Temple and taught (St John vii.
14). On the last day of the feast, He stood in the
Temple and cried, referring to the usual libation of the
Jews on this day,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> “If any man thirst, let him come
to Me and drink” (v. 37). On this day, in the Eastern
Churches, the rite of blessing the waters still takes place,
which is not to be confused with that which is performed
on the 6th January, in honour of the baptism of Jesus
in Jordan (<i>missa aquæ</i>). This commemoration is called
by the Greeks μεσοπεντεκοστή, <i>festum mediæ pentecostes</i>.
The name, as we have already observed, belongs
to the oldest ecclesiastical terminology, according to
which Pentecost meant not Whitsunday but the whole
period from Easter to Whitsunday.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<h5>6. <i>The Preparation for Easter—Quadragesima and the
Fast</i></h5>

<p>The chief festivals are usually preceded by a time
of preparation, consisting in many cases of only a single
day, the vigil, but the preparation for Easter extends
over nine weeks, and is composed of two parts, Lent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the more immediate preparation, and the three preceding
Sundays, as a more distant and merely liturgical
preparation.</p>

<p>In Lent, it is the fast which plays the chief part,
and presents itself as the essential feature of the whole
time of preparation. From it, also, the other developments
take their rise.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>There are indications that, in the earliest times,
Christians fasted on all Wednesdays and Fridays
throughout the year. This pious custom seems to have
been so generally observed that, without having been
enjoined by any formal enactment, it had, so to speak,
the force of law. It is mentioned in the Didaché,
in Hermas, and by Tertullian.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The latter calls these
fasts “station-fasts,” and mentions that the fast lasted
until 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> The custom had possibly been adopted
from the Jews, for the Pharisees and Jewish ascetics
in the time of Christ were wont to fast twice a week,
on Monday and Thursday.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the East, Clement of Alexandria
mentions<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Wednesday and Friday as fast days, and,
which is especially remarkable, these days were also
so observed in the period after Constantine, at least for
a great part of the year. The <i>Didascalia</i> enjoins that
these days be kept as fasts in the time after Whitsunday.
The preceding season, the fifty days between Easter
and Whitsunday, was a season of unmixed gladness,
and so, according to the <i>Didascalia</i>, in Whitsun Week,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
these days were not fasts. We are led to the conjecture
that this custom fell out of use in proportion as fasting
became otherwise regulated, and the fast of forty days
before Easter became a general law.</p>

<p>That fasting should form an essential feature in the
commemoration of Passion-tide had already been
indicated in our Lord’s words (St Matt. ix. 15): “Can
the children of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the
bridegroom is with them?” To which question He
Himself replied, “The days will come, when the bridegroom
shall be taken away from them, and then shall
they fast.” The days when the Bridegroom was taken
away were held from the first to be those in which He
lay in the grave, Good Friday and Holy Saturday.
In the earliest times, these days were everywhere kept
as fasts, and were observed by all, with exception of the
quartodecimans, as obligatory fasts of the strictest
kind.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>This fact is supported by a remark of St Irenæus,
in an official letter addressed to Pope Victor (189-99),
on the occasion of the second dispute about Easter. It
is given, for the most part, by Eusebius in his history
of the Church.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> This is the earliest evidence for the
fast before Easter. It shows that the practice had not
yet received a fixed and special form. Some, for instance,
thought only one day ought to be kept as a fast, Good
Friday; others fasted for two days, Good Friday and
Holy Saturday—the two days, as Tertullian says, on
which the Bridegroom was taken away. Others again
fasted for more than two days (unfortunately, it is
not said for how many), and others reckoned as their
fast day, forty consecutive hours. That is to say, they
kept a continuous fast for forty hours night and day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and regarded this as their fast day.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Which these
forty hours were is easy to say, for our Lord lay in
the grave for about forty hours, from the afternoon of
Good Friday until Easter morning, or from Good
Friday morning to the evening of Saturday.</p>

<p>Irenæus and Tertullian know nothing as yet of
the fast of forty days, although in their days it was the
universal custom to fast, and that very strictly, on the
two last days of Holy Week. About the middle of
the third century, a week’s fast was customary in many
places—the entire Holy Week being fasted on water
and bread and salt, while on the last two days nothing
whatever was eaten. The <i>Didascalia</i> describes the fast
in the same way, and also the Apostolic Constitutions
(5, 15). After this manner, accordingly, the fast was
observed in Syria, and Dionysius witnesses to the same
practice in Alexandria.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>However the words, “The fast shall be broken when a
Sunday intervenes,”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> found on the well-known statue
of Hippolytus in Rome, show that already, by the middle
of the third century, the fast extended over several
weeks. The fast here alluded to must have extended
over fourteen days at least. The disputed canons of
Hippolytus (the twentieth and twenty-second) receive
some confirmation from this passage.</p>

<p>In the fourth century, many witnesses to the fast
of forty days are forthcoming, both writers, such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
Eusebius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Ambrose, etc., as well as
ecclesiastical enactments, <i>e.g.</i>, the sixty-ninth of the
Apostolic Canons. The Fifth canon of the First Council
of Nicæa, in particular, mentions Lent as an observance
already established. Nevertheless it clearly was not
as yet uniformly observed in all parts of the Church,
as the Festal Letters of St Athanasius bear witness.</p>

<p>These letters are in any case the most important
evidence for the fast of forty days before Easter. The
first of them, for the year 329, is satisfied with appointing
“a holy fast of six days” from the Monday to the
Saturday in Holy Week;<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> the second, however, for 330,
and all the following require a fast of forty days, beginning
on the Monday of the sixth complete week before
Easter.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The Festal Letters give no direct explanation
of how, and for what reason, the six days’ fast was
changed into a fast of forty days.</p>

<p>However, the covering letter which Athanasius sent
along with his eleventh Festal Letter, written from
Rome in 339, throws some light upon the process.
He writes, namely, to Serapion, first Abbot and then
Bishop of Thmuis, that he may announce the fast of
forty days to his brethren and impress upon them the
necessity of the fast, “lest, when all the world fasts,
we only who live in Egypt be derided for not fasting.”
This warning is repeated with still greater emphasis:
Serapion is to instruct those under him that they must
fast forty days,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> which seems to show that the custom
of fasting for forty days was not yet in force in Egypt,
though elsewhere it was universally observed, and
especially in Rome. At the conclusion of the nineteenth
Festal Letter is found a sharp reproof of those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
disregarded the fast.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> This is the forty days’ discipline
(ἄσκησις) observed during the six weeks before Easter
according to Eusebius.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>The Gallic pilgrim, already so often quoted, gives the
following minute information concerning the manner
in which the fasts were observed in Jerusalem in the
fourth century. The preparatory period before Easter
lasted eight weeks, not forty days, as in Gaul, and all
the days of the week, Saturday and Sunday excepted,
were fasted. Holy Saturday was an exception to this
rule, being kept as a fast. Thus there were in all forty-one
fast days, which were called in Greek ἑορταί; in
Latin, <i>feriæ</i>. On Wednesday in Lent, the Psalmody
was performed as on Sunday, and the bishop read the
appointed Gospel, but the Mass (<i>oblatio</i>) was offered only
on Saturday and Sunday. On certain days processions
were also made to different churches which lasted until
eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>The fare on fast days consisted of water and broth
made with flour; fruit and oil and bread were also
eaten. The catechumens also fasted on Wednesdays and
Fridays. Among the faithful, there were some who
ate nothing from their repast on Sunday until the
following Saturday, <i>i.e.</i> for five days, and who all the
year round took only one meal a day. Others abstained
in Lent from all food for two consecutive days, but others
fasted by taking nothing to eat all day until the evening.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
This last recalls the practice described by Irenæus.
Here one may observe that the custom of not fasting
on the Saturdays in Lent existed also in Milan in the
time of St Ambrose.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The fast must have commenced on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
the Monday after Sexagesima Sunday, since it had to
extend over forty days.</p>

<p>With this agrees the directions given in the so-called
Apostolic Constitutions (5, 13-20). In these, the fast
of Holy Week is called distinctively the fast of Easter
(νηστεία τοῦ πάσχα), and is distinguished from the
fast of Lent.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> From Monday to Friday in Holy Week,
the fast is to be kept on bread, salt, vegetables and
water, flesh meat and wine being forbidden. On Good
Friday and Holy Saturday, the days when the Bridegroom
was taken away, those who are able are to eat
nothing whatever until early on Easter Sunday, while
the usual fast lasted until 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, or sunset.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> On
Saturday, people are not to fast, because it is the day
on which the Creation was complete, with the exception
of the Saturday on which the Lord lay in the
earth.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Leo the Great in his sermons teaches us the objects
and significance of the fast before Easter. According
to him, Lent was appointed in order to prepare souls
for a fruitful commemoration of the mystery of Easter.
It was to be a time for inner purification and sanctification;
a time, first of all, of penance for past sins, and
of breaking off sinful habits, a time also for the exercise
of all virtues, especially almsgiving, reconciliation, and
the laying aside of enmities. It was in correspondence
with the spirit of Lent that the Christian emperors
pardoned criminals.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Fasting was to form only a part
of this penance and preparation, though the most
essential part, and Leo declares it to be incumbent upon
all, not only the clergy, but all the faithful as well.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Leo regarded this fast of forty days before Easter as
an apostolic institution.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>When the duration of the fast became generally
fixed at forty days, a reason for this was not far to seek—the
length of the fast of Jesus. From the beginning,
however, a difference became apparent, according as
Holy Week was either included in Lent or regarded
as something distinct in itself. The ante-Nicene
practice afforded a precedent for this. The latter
practice is adopted in particular in the Apostolic
Constitutions, and prevailed in a great part of the East.
But in the East, Saturday was exempt from fasting,
and so the number of fast days was, as a matter of fact,
not greater than in the West, where the other practice
obtained. Later, it was expressly set forth that Lent
should be a <i>quadragesima</i>, not a <i>quinquagesima</i>, as
by the first and fourth councils of Orleans in the sixth
century.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> In some quarters, our informant unfortunately
does not say where, Thursday was also exempted from
fasting.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Originally, it appears, the fast of forty days, <i>quadragesima</i>,
was taken to mean the days before Easter as a
whole, Sundays included. This gave for a period of
six weeks only thirty-six fasting days, and, where
Saturday was not kept as a fast day, only thirty. To
rectify this, the number of fast days was increased
actually to forty, with the result that in the West, the
beginning of Lent (<i>caput jejunii</i>) was put back four
days; but in the East, where only five days in each
week were fasted, it was put back further still. In the
West, especially in Rome, this alteration, by which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
fast began on the Wednesday before the sixth Sunday
before Easter, had not yet been accomplished by the
time of Gregory the Great.</p>

<p>In the East, too, the tendency to make up the full
number of fast days to forty was apparent also at
an early date. There, owing to Saturday not being a
fast day, the beginning of Lent had to be thrown further
back than in the West, and Lent began eight weeks
before Easter, and since the Saturdays, Holy Saturday
excepted, were not fast days, extended actually over
forty-one days instead of forty. Abstinence from flesh
meat began on the Monday after the eighth Sunday
before Easter, corresponding to the Latin <i>dominica
sexagesima</i>, which is called the Sunday of Abstinence
from Flesh Meat (κυριακὴ ἀπόκρεως). From the
following Sunday, called the Sunday for Eating Cheese
(κυριακὴ τοῦ τυροφάγου), <i>lacticinia</i> are forbidden. The
following Sundays are reckoned as merely the first to the
fifth Sundays in Lent, and only the first of them has
the additional designation of Orthodox Sunday, in
commemoration of the settlement of the Iconoclastic
controversy. Later on, the Easterns attached great
importance to the question whether Saturday ought
or ought not to be kept as a fast day. As early, indeed,
as the Apostolic Canons, it is expressly forbidden to
fast on Saturday under threat of ecclesiastical penalties.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
At a later date this difference became one of the points
of dispute between the Greeks and Latins.</p>

<p>The assertion of Socrates<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> that in Rome the fast
lasted only three weeks is now regarded on all hands
as erroneous, all the more so as Socrates adds—also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
incorrectly—“Saturdays and Sundays excepted.” In
Rome, Saturday was always kept as a fast. His statement
cannot be accepted against the clear evidence of
Leo I. concerning Lent, even although Valesius and
Baillet wish to defend it.</p>

<p>That the fast of forty days was not originally observed
in all parts of the Church, and only gradually came into
force, can probably be explained by the fact that there
were already fast days enough. There are, for instance,
many indications that the custom of fasting on Wednesdays
and Fridays all the year through—the period
between Easter and Pentecost excepted—was fairly
generally observed. Wednesday was kept as a fast, because
on that day our Lord had been betrayed to the
Jews; Friday, because it was the day of His Passion.
At Carthage, where we find reliable evidence for the
practice, they were called the fasts of the stations.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
Even in the East, the custom was apparently general.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
The Apostolic Constitutions are acquainted with it; the
so-called Apostolic Canons prescribe it;<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> the Canons of
Hippolytus<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> refer to the fast of the fourth and sixth <i>feria</i>
as well as the fast of Lent. As these fasts are never
mentioned in the literature of a later date, and altogether
disappeared from practice, one is driven to the conclusion
that, as the Lenten fast became more widely observed,
these others fell out of use. However, the weekly
fast-days continued to be observed for a long time
together with the Lenten fast, and, among the
Greeks, are observed even to the present day.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Not
only Augustine mentions that, at the end of the fourth
century, in Rome, Wednesdays, Fridays, and also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Saturdays were fasted, but Innocent I. regarded it as
a duty to fast on Saturday all the year round, and
Prudentius also alludes to it.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> In the Syrian Church
the three weekly fasts appear to have been obligatory
on Bishops and Priests alone.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>After the adoption of the fast of forty days, attempts
were made, in the West, to further regulate fasting, but
these were confined to certain districts and in course of
time ceased. For example, Bishop Perpetuus of Tours
introduced a special practice into his diocese, which
lasted until on in the sixth century, <i>i.e.</i> from Whitsunday
to St John, and also from 1st September to St
Martin, two fast-days were observed in each week; from
then until Christmas, three; from St Hilary’s Day (14th
January) until the middle of February two again. The
second canon of the fourth council of Orleans (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 541)
opposed the attempts of some bishops to extend the
fast over fifty, or even sixty days. Amalarius mentions
other divergences from the Roman custom, such as
keeping three Lents in the year, one before Christmas,
the second before Easter, and the third before Whitsunday,
and, again, fasting on the days before the
Ascension.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In Germany, too, there were peculiarities
in the discipline observed with regard to fasting during
the eighth and ninth centuries.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The essence of fasting consists in abstinence from
meat and drink during a specified time. This in itself
is not sufficient, for fasting entails moreover that the
food taken after the lapse of this time be of a plainer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
kind, <i>i.e.</i> abstinence from the better sorts of food
and drink, which is now called abstinence in the strict
sense. The prohibition of certain meats in the Old
Testament must be regarded as of a disciplinary nature,
and not as a merely dietary regulation.</p>

<p>In ecclesiastical antiquity, along with abstinence
from the usual daily meals, we find certain viands
also forbidden—flesh and wine. To this period belong
the <i>xerophagiæ</i> spoken of by Tertullian,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> at which
people abstained not only from flesh and wine but
from liquid food and fruit as well. These, however, seem
to have gone beyond the abstinence then usual throughout
the Church. The Montanists held these <i>xerophagiæ</i>
twice a year for fourteen days.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Among Catholics also abstinence was pushed to great
lengths. The canons of Hippolytus<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> prescribe for Holy
Week only bread and salt. The Apostolic Constitutions
will only permit bread, vegetables, salt and water, in
Lent, flesh and wine being forbidden; and, on the last
two days of Holy Week, nothing whatsoever is to be
eaten.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The ascetics, whose acquaintance the Gallic
pilgrim made in Jerusalem, never touched bread in
Lent, but lived on flour and water.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Only a few could
keep so strict a fast, and generally speaking people were
satisfied with abstaining from flesh and wine. But
this lasted throughout the entire Lent, and Chrysostom<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
tells us that in Antioch no flesh was eaten during the
whole of Lent. Abstinence from milk and eggs (the
so-called <i>lacticinia</i>) was also the general rule.</p>

<p>Thus abstinence from flesh meat (<i>i.e.</i> abstinence in
the strict sense) was combined with the diminution of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
quantity of food taken. It was also voluntarily practised
by itself, without being accompanied by fasting (<i>jejunium
a carne et sanguine</i>), by pious persons and ascetics, and
was prescribed as a duty on certain days in monasteries
and other religious communities, as, for instance, among
the Canons of Chrodegang.</p>

<p>Throughout the early ages, abstinence was merely
a pious custom. It was not until a later date that it
was enjoined by law, as, for instance, by the fifty-sixth
Trullan Canon, the Decree of Nicholas I. for the Bulgarians,
the fourth and eighth councils of Toledo, the
seventh canon of the council of Quedlinburg (1085), and
the decretal of Gratian.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The custom of abstinence was
then recognised and prescribed by ecclesiastical law
for the whole of Lent, for all Fridays and Saturdays
throughout the year, for the Ember Day, and a number
of vigils.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> No authentic document of antiquity is forthcoming
to show that abstinence by itself, without an
accompanying fast, had been prescribed by the Church.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<h5>7. <i>The Season of Preparation as an Integral Part
of the Church’s Year</i></h5>

<p>The division of this season of preparation into
two parts, with special names for the Sundays, does
not appear in the sermons of Augustine or Leo the
Great. But in the ancient Gallic sacramentary—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
<i>missale Gothico-Gallicanum</i>—five Masses, entitled
simply <i>missa jejunii</i> or <i>in quadragesima</i>, are found
assigned to the five Sundays before Palm Sunday. The
names <i>sexagesima</i> and <i>quinquagesima</i> appear already in
the canons of the fourth council of Orleans (541), but,
as generally recognised titles for the Sundays before
Easter, they begin to appear in service-books dating
from the eighth century and onwards. The Gregorian
Sacramentary is familiar with the names for the Sundays
from Septuagesima to Quinquagesima, and then numbers
five Sundays in Quadragesima until Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>In the ancient Spanish Mozarabic Sacramentary, the
names Septuagesima, etc., do not yet appear, but the
Sundays after Epiphany are numbered from one to
eight, although the entire number was not always
required, according as Easter fell early or late. After
them follows the <i>Dominica ante diem Cineris</i>, then
the five Sundays in Lent, and, finally, the <i>Dominica in
Ramis Palmarum</i>.</p>

<p>The recently published Lectionary of Silos, belonging
to the ancient rite of Toledo and compiled about 650,
represents a much simpler form of the Church’s year.
It enumerates neither the Sundays after Epiphany
nor those after Pentecost, but merely those in Lent,
and then is satisfied with twenty-four Masses for the
remaining Sundays of the year.</p>

<p>A trace of the original length of Lent—six weeks,
or forty-two days—exists still in the present missal,
inasmuch as the <i>secreta</i> for the First Sunday in Lent
runs: <i>Sacrificium quadragesimalis initii solemniter immolamus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
Sundays, as we know, were never kept as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
fasts, and so the Western Church in reality kept only
thirty-six fast days, a proof that the word <i>quadragesima</i>
originally merely denoted the number of days over
which the period of preparation extended. Since,
however, our Lord had fasted forty days, the Church
felt moved to keep to this number exactly, and so
added the four missing days to the beginning of Lent.
This alternation was first accomplished at the end of
the seventh or beginning of the eighth century, and
appears for the first time in the so-called Gelasian
sacramentary,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> while Gregory I.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> himself still counted
the days actually fasted as thirty-six. The three preceding
Sundays were now included in the season of preparation
and received the names of Quinquagesima, Sexagesima,
and Septuagesima. The actual commencement
of the fast fell on the Wednesday before Quadragesima,
which appears in the Gregorian Sacramentary with a
Mass of its own, but without its present name of Ash
Wednesday (<i>Feria IV. Cinerum</i>).</p>

<p>This name comes from the sprinkling of ashes.
Sprinkling ashes upon the heads of penitents, in token
of sorrow, formed part of the ancient ceremonies connected
with ecclesiastical penance. Since public penance
usually began and ended with Lent, this custom
was associated with this particular day. It soon became
a general custom no longer restricted to penitents,
although the Council of Benevento (1091) prescribes
it principally for clerics. The ashes were prepared from
the palms of the previous Palm Sunday. At the present
time they are blessed in addition.</p>

<p>It is to be observed further that Lent is not devoted
to consideration of Christ’s sufferings. This occupies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the mind during Holy Week. The aim of Lent is not
to move the faithful to dwell upon the passion of Christ,
but only to prepare them for keeping Easter worthily
through fasting, penance, and abstinence. The liturgical
prayers in Lent contain no reference to the Redeemer’s
sufferings, but speak of fasting and mortification alone.
It is the same with the Epistles and Gospels. On Palm
Sunday for the first time, our thoughts are directed
to the Passion in the collect for the day, while in the
prayers for the so-called Passion Sunday it is not
mentioned.</p>

<p>Those weeks of Lent had an exceptional character in
which, in the sixth and following centuries, the scrutinies
took place, <i>i.e.</i> the services designed for the examination
of candidates in preparation for baptism. These began
on the Wednesday of the third week in Lent, and lasted
until Holy Saturday. Originally seven, they were reduced
in course of time to three, owing to the adoption
of the Gelasian sacramentary. Accordingly, the Masses
for the third, fourth, and fifth Sunday and for the
Saturday before Passion Sunday speak of baptism and
not of the Passion.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> In the present Roman Missal
scarcely a trace of this is to be found.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>The prayers of the Masses both for Sundays and week-days,
for by far the greater part, are still identical with
those of the Gregorian Sacramentary, while the lections
from Scripture are in some instances much older. The
Gospel for the First Sunday in Lent, which narrates the
fast of Jesus and His temptation by the devil, was read
on this day already in the time of Leo the Great. The
Gospel for the second Sunday treats of the Transfiguration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
on Mount Tabor, the Gospels for the two following
Sundays, the healing of the dumb man, and the casting
out of the devil, and the miracle of the loaves. The
Gospel for Passion Sunday contains the account of our
Lord’s encounter with the Jews and their attempt to
stone Him.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, the commencement and beginning
of Lent was marked in a way visible to all by hanging
a curtain between the nave of the church and the choir
on Ash Wednesday, or, according to Durandus, on the
First Sunday in Lent. This was called the Lenten Veil,
or, in common parlance, the “Hunger-veil.” It remained
hanging until Good Friday, but in many places
was drawn aside on Sundays, obviously because Sundays
were not fast days. The veil was usually quite plain,
but sometimes it was adorned with pictorial representations
from sacred history. It is first referred to in writings
of the ninth century, but was in use much earlier.
In some places in Westphalia and Hanover it exists
to the present day. These Lenten-veils are still to be
frequently seen in museums and church lumber-rooms,
where not infrequently they are erroneously mistaken
for carpets. They were practical in their object—the
ordinary man who had no calendar was put in remembrance
by them that it was the season of Lent. Allegorical
interpretations were naturally not lacking, and are
to be found in Rupert of Deutz.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> A similar custom also
exists in Russia, where, on the first Sunday in Lent,
the altar curtains are drawn together and so remain
until Palm Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>During the first six centuries, it was taken for granted
that saints’ days must not be observed during Lent.
The Trullan synod introduced the first exception to
this rule in favour of the Annunciation. In the West,
this rule was soon entirely set aside, but, on the other
hand, in token of sorrow, the Allelujah ceases during
the entire Lent, a custom of which the Greek Church
knows nothing. The Lenten prayers have a particularly
earnest tone, and Lent from quite an early date appears
richly provided from a liturgical point of view, each
week-day having its own special Mass. In old days in
Rome, there was a procession every day, for the Pope
and clergy proceeded from the papal palace in solemn
array to some church in the city where a halt (<i>statio</i>)
was made, and Mass was sung.</p>

<h5>8. <i>The Transfiguration</i></h5>

<p>In the existing calendar, the Transfiguration of our
Lord is commemorated by a special festival, the <i>festum
Transfigurationis</i>, which, as it is kept on a fixed date,
is excluded from the proper sequence of the ecclesiastical
year and treated in the same manner as the saints’ days.
From quite an early date, this festival had been celebrated
in divers churches, both East and West, on different
days. The date now observed, the 6th August, was
appointed for the festival by Calixtus III. in 1457, in
memory of the victory over the Turks, gained by John
Capistran and George Hunyadi, at Belgrade. In the
choice of a day, he seems to have been influenced by the
Greek calendar, where the festival had already been
kept on this day. It appears in the Synaxaria of the
Copts in Selden and Mai, in the menology of Constantinople
belonging to the eighth century, and, later,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
in the <i>Neapolitanum</i>, and among the orthodox Syrians.
In the East it was commonly observed. Sermons on
the event are found among those of St Augustine and
Leo the Great.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The tendency to transfer to another
period of the year the commemoration of those events
which fell within Lent, is also perceptible in the case
of the feast of the Seven Dolours. More will be said on
this point in the second part.</p>

<h5>9. <i>The Ascension</i></h5>

<p>A special festival in commemoration of the return
of the Redeemer to heaven does not indeed appear in
the earliest lists of Church festivals given by Tertullian
and Origen in the third century. Still, the terms in
which the earliest witnesses refer to it, prove that this
day was kept as a festival in quite early times. The
first witness for it is Eusebius, who calls it a high festival
in the treatise he composed on the discussions concerning
Easter at the first General Council in 325. The
ecclesiastical historian Socrates speaks of it as a general
festival.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> With regard to documents of an official
character, the church-order contained in the so-called
Apostolic Constitutions,<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> gives it the name of The Taking
Up [into Heaven] (ἀνάλεψις, St Luke ix. 51, where
the form ἁνάλημψις occurs). Numerous sermons
among the works of the Fathers afford further evidence
for the existence of the feast. Augustine<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> is inclined
to attribute the appointment of the festival to an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
ordinance of the Apostles or to the injunction of a general
council. The latter cannot be proved as certain. As
soon as persecution ceased, the feast of the Ascension
made its way naturally in all parts of the Church, unassisted
by any authoritative enactment, for it was
impossible that the concluding act of our Saviour’s
earthly life should remain unnoticed among festivals
and in the Liturgy. This was all the more unlikely,
as the spot from which our Lord returned to the Father
at once became the object of reverence. The Empress
Helena had already ordered a splendid basilica to be
built on the Mount of Olives, which, unfortunately,
was destroyed by the Saracens, and has never been
rebuilt. At the present day, a small unimposing church
marks the spot which was a place of pilgrimage as early
as the fourth century,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and where it is believed one of
our Lord’s footprints in still visible.</p>

<p>With regard to the liturgical observance of the day,
its chief characteristic until well on in the Middle Ages
was a procession. At the time of the Gallic pilgrim’s
visit to Jerusalem, this was observed in a striking
manner. The people proceeded in solemn procession
after the sixth hour (towards 12 o’clock) on Wednesday
from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, there to celebrate the
Vigil in the church built over the grotto where Christ
was born. The next day, divine service, with a sermon,
was performed in the accustomed manner, and, in the
evening, the procession returned to Jerusalem.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The
question which naturally presents itself, why the service
was not rather held on the Mount of Olives, as it was
in the eighth century,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> remains unanswered. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
to be further observed that the name Ascension (<i>ascensa</i>)
is not used to designate the festival. The pilgrim
simply speaks of the fortieth day (<i>quadragesima</i>) after
Easter.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the East, it was customary to observe
the Festival of the Ascension outside the city, as, for
example, in Constantinople and Antioch. In the latter
place, the people went to the small town of Romanesia,
where Chrysostom delivered his sermon on the feast.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
In the Middle Ages, processions were wont to take place
on this day in Gaul and Germany, and this custom
shows how deeply people were moved by the desire to
imitate as far as possible, in the introduction of liturgical
practices, the actions of our Lord. In this case, the
determinating factor was that our Lord had led the
Apostles out of the city to the Mount of Olives.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Another custom peculiar to this festival is that, after
the reading of the Gospel at the High Mass, the Paschal
candle, which up till then has been burnt at all High
Masses, is extinguished and put aside. In earlier times,
the event of the day was represented by hanging up
a figure of our Lord, which was made to disappear
through an opening in the roof. The festival has an
octave since the fifteenth century, and, in consequence,
the following Sunday, formerly called simply <i>Dominica
post Ascensionem</i>, is now called <i>Dominica infra Octavam</i>.
The Mass of the feast forms one of the rare exceptions
where the event commemorated is described in the
Epistle, Acts i. 1-11. The Gospel for the day is taken
from St Mark xvi. 14-20, where, in verse 19, the Ascension
is briefly alluded to. As a matter of fact, verses 10-20<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
are wanting in the oldest Alexandrian MSS. Still they
are in other respects well supported, and must be regarded
as genuine.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>The introduction of the festival of the Ascension was
rendered all the easier since Scripture distinctly specifies
the day on which the event took place.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<h5>10. <i>Whitsunday</i></h5>

<p>Whitsunday is of equal rank with the two other chief
festivals, but has no special season either preceding
or following it, and is unattended by any lesser festivals
depending upon it. Whitsunday is the close of the
whole period which began with Easter, called in the
early centuries <i>Quinquagesima</i>, because it extended over
fifty days. This entire period is festal in character,
and therefore so long as it lasted people in ancient days
prayed standing upright, and no fasting was practised.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
The ascetics did not observe a single fast during this
time,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and it seems that even the day before Whitsunday
was not a fast in the earliest ages, any more than it is
now among the Greeks. A number of ascetics were of
opinion that this period of joy should last only forty
days, because our Lord appeared to His disciples for
only forty days, and that the following ten days, as
far as fasting, prayer, and kneeling were concerned,
should be like the rest of the year—an opinion which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Cassian, among others (Coll. 20, 21), strongly opposed.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
This divergence of opinion, which was rather widespread,
seems to have resulted in Whitsunday being
passed over and ignored. So, for example, it is entirely
omitted from the oldest Gallican Sacramentaries, the
series of festivals ending with the Ascension.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> In the
later service-books, it appears simply under the name
<i>Quinquagesima</i>.</p>

<p>Pentecost meant originally the entire period from
Easter to Whitsunday, and this terminology had been
already in use among the Jews, and is employed by St
Luke in Acts ii. 1 (<i>cum complerentur dies pentecostes</i>).
The Greek word Pentecost was gladly adopted by the
Latins in early times, and more especially, later on,
since the Latin term <i>quinquagesima</i> might easily be
confused with the Sunday of the same name.</p>

<p>Whitsunday, of course, commemorates the descent
of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles and disciples.
This happened fifty days after the Resurrection, on an
ancient Jewish festival called in the Pentateuch the
Feast of Weeks,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> because it was celebrated exactly
seven weeks after the Passover. As it fell on the fiftieth
day after the Passover, it was also called Pentecost,
even in pre-Christian times.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>The Jewish Pentecost was originally only a festival
of thanksgiving for harvest, and, although the Law was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
given on Mount Sinai and the Mosaic Church came into
existence on the same day, yet the feast was not devoted
to the commemoration of this event. This purpose
was served by the festival of the Simchah Thorah in
October, which owed its institution to the Rabbis. On
the other hand, the fact that the descent of the Holy
Ghost implied the foundation of the Christian Church,
afforded the Fathers a parallel which they were not
slow to make the most of.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The Feast of Weeks was
to the Jews only the conclusion of the harvest, in
thanksgiving for which, bread, made from the newly
gathered wheat, was presented to Jehovah as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>The festival of Whitsunday reaches back to the commencement
of the Church, although there is no evidence
for it, as there is in the case of Easter, it being uncertain
whether the passage, 1 Cor. xvi. 8, refers to the Jewish
or to the Christian Pentecost. This is not astonishing,
for, on the one hand the feast, originally of only one day’s
duration, fell on a Sunday, and, on the other, it is so
closely bound up with Easter that the one entails the
other. That the festival of Whitsunday belongs to
Apostolic times is stated in the seventh of the fragments
attributed to Irenæus, but these are admitted to be
interpolated. In Tertullian, the festival, along with
Easter, appears as already well established, so that it
must have been in existence for some time. As at
Easter, prayer was made standing, and it was the second
and last date for the solemn baptism of catechumens.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
Tertullian, moreover, in accordance with the usage
already in use, gives the name of Pentecost, not merely
to the day of the festival, but to the whole period from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Easter to Whitsunday—a use of the term which appears
here and there at a later date,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and points out the
period as a time of joy.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The last day, however, was
clearly held in Tertullian’s time to be a festival in an
especial sense.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Origen and the Canons of Hippolytus
make references in passing to the festival of Whitsunday.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
The Apostolic Constitutions say Whitsunday is to be
regarded as a high festival, because on it the Lord Jesus
sent down the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The Gallic pilgrim gives a detailed and circumstantial
account of the manner in which the feast was observed
in Jerusalem.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> On the night before Whitsunday, the
vigil was celebrated in the Church of the Anastasis, at
which the bishop, according to the usual custom in
Jerusalem on Sundays, read the Gospel of the Resurrection,
and the customary psalmody was performed. At
dawn, all the people proceeded to the principal church
(<i>Martyrium</i>), where a sermon was preached and Mass
celebrated. About the third hour, when the psalmody
was finished, the people accompanied the bishop with
singing to Sion. There, the passage from the Acts of the
Apostles, describing the descent of the Holy Ghost, was
read, and a second Mass was celebrated, after which
the psalmody was resumed. Afterwards the archdeacon
invited the people to assemble in the “Eleona,” from
whence a procession was made to the summit of the
Mount of Olives. Here psalms and antiphons were
sung, the Gospel was read, and the blessing given. After
this, the people descended again into the “Eleona,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
where Vespers were sung, and then, with the bishop at
their head, proceeded in a solemn procession with
singing back to the principal church, which was reached
towards 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> At the city gate, the procession was
met by torch-bearers who accompanied it to the
<i>Martyrium</i>. Here, as well as in the Anastasis, to which
the people proceeded in turn, and in the Chapel of the
Holy Cross, the usual prayers, hymns, and blessings
took place, so that the festival did not conclude until
midnight.</p>

<p>The Pilgrim makes no mention of rites or preparations
connected with the administration of baptism. It
seems, then, that in Jerusalem, Whitsunday was not
observed as a second or supplementary time for baptism,
or may not have been required as such. Nevertheless,
this feature appears in the Western liturgies, and had
much to do, for instance, in the determining the manner
in which the vigil of the feast was observed.</p>

<p>According to the more ancient service-books, the
catechumens were to assemble at midday on Saturday.
Lections from Scripture, less numerous than on Holy
Saturday, were read, and then, after suitable prayers,
took place the blessing of the baptismal water, the
baptism, and, during the night, the Mass of the vigil.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
St Augustine shows that, in Africa as well, the people
assembled in the afternoon, and that the Mass was
celebrated during the night. He thus addresses the
newly baptised on Whitsunday: “What you here see
before you on the altar, you have already seen during
the past night.”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>In order to complete the resemblance to Easter, a
large candle was, in some churches, blessed and set up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
during the singing of the <i>Exsultet</i> in a slightly altered
form.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> In monastic churches, in which baptism was
not administered, the baptismal ceremonies were omitted,
though the special celebration of the vigil still commenced
in the afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>As far as the most ancient period is concerned, the
so-called Leonine Missal contains a Mass for Whitsunday,
and the ceremonies for baptism. The Gelasian Sacramentary
also has numerous directions for the administration
of baptism on this day, but no form for the blessing
of a candle. It seems to imply that the candidates for
baptism shall be especially invalids, or such as for some
reason or other had been prevented from receiving
baptism at Easter, or Energumens, etc. These directions,
however, are absent from the Gregorian Sacramentary,
and only two lections from the prophets are
given. In the present Roman rite, the function takes
place in the forenoon; still the prophecies and the
blessing of the font remain as survivals of the ancient
practice. The litany of the saints is also sung, upon
the last Kyrie of which the Mass of the vigil follows
immediately without an introit. The office of
the day until nones belongs to the Octave of the
Ascension.</p>

<p>The Apostolic Constitutions<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> speak of the feast of
Pentecost lasting for eight days, but in the West it was
not kept with an octave until quite a late date, and the
last day was never called <i>dies octava</i>, but merely the
first Sunday after Pentecost, and the days within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
octave were merely called the first or second day after
Pentecost, and so on. As appears from Berno of
Reichenau,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> it was a debatable point in his day whether
Whitsunday ought to be kept with, or without, a <i>dies
octava</i>. Berno relied upon the analogy of Easter, the
special time for baptisms, which was observed with an
octave. Whitsunday was the day on which the
Apostles received their baptism of fire, and so it too
ought to have an octave. He had other reasons besides
which would have no weight at the present time. It is
obvious that Whitsunday had at first no octave, which
can be inferred also from the whole scheme of the Church’s
feasts. Whitsunday was merely the fiftieth day after
Easter, the end of the period called Pentecost, and so in
itself brought the season to a conclusion.</p>

<p>The Mass for Whitsunday had a sequence which was
repeated daily during the week. Formerly the law-courts
did not sit during the entire week, and even servile
work was forbidden as well.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> A Council of Constance,
in 1094, limited this to the first three days of the week.
With us, at the present time, only the second day is
observed <i>in foro</i>, but not even this is observed any longer
in Rome.</p>

<p>In earlier times it was customary in many places to
scatter roses from the roof of the church to recall the
miracle of Pentecost. Hence in Sicily, Whitsunday is
called <i>pascha rosatum</i>. The Italian name, <i>pasqua rossa</i>,
however, comes from the colour of the vestments. In
many districts of France it was usual to blow trombones
or trumpets during divine service in memory of the
sound of the “mighty wind” which accompanied the
Holy Spirit’s descent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<h5>11. <i>Trinity Sunday</i></h5>

<p>It was not until a late date that the first Sunday after
Pentecost was raised to a higher rank, for in the
Gregorian Sacramentary it has no special name, while
in the Gelasian Sacramentary, and in the appendixes to
the Gregorian,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> it is called merely the Sunday after
the octave of Pentecost, or the Sunday after Pentecost.
In the Latin Church, it is now a festival devoted to the
honour of the Most Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>Concerning the introduction of this new feast into the
Church’s year, we learn from the Micrologus that, the
Sunday after Pentecost being a <i>dominica vacans</i> without
any special office of its own, many used on this day the
office of the Trinity drawn up by Bishop Stephen of
Liège (903-20). When Pope Alexander II. († 1073) was
questioned on the point, he replied that it was not
the Roman custom to set apart any particular day in
honour of the Holy Trinity, since the Trinity was
honoured every day by the <i>Gloria Patri</i> in the psalmody.
It is to be noted, continues the Micrologus,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> that
Alcuin, at the request of the Saint Boniface, composed
a Mass in honour of the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>Binterim speaks sarcastically of this reference, because
Boniface had died long before the time when Alcuin
flourished. The reference is not to be passed over on
this account, for the mistake arose merely from a misunderstanding.
Alcuin had put together from the
missal employed in his Abbey Church a number of
Masses—votive Masses, as they would now be called—for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
each day of the week, to be used under certain
conditions, and to these was added, amongst others, a
Mass in honour of St Boniface for the monks of Fulda.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
This explains the misunderstanding in the Micrologus.
Alcuin had also arranged a collection of prayers drawn
from the Gregorian Sacramentary to form a prayer-book.
This, by itself, enables us now to appreciate
Alcuin’s share in the matter.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> It merely means that
he recommended the Mass of the Trinity should be
said on Sundays, in case a priest had not a complete
missal, or through ignorance was unable to use it
properly.</p>

<p>The fact is plain. The later Frankish recension of
the Gregorian Sacramentary contained for the Sunday
after Pentecost a Mass in honour of the Holy Trinity,
with the same preface which is still in use.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> In addition
to this, Bishop Stephen of Liège drew up a suitable office,
and so all was in readiness for the institution of an
especial feast in honour of the Trinity, which, in the
natural course of things, was fixed for the first Sunday
after Pentecost. The custom of regarding it as a festival
became more and more popular in the Netherlands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
England, Germany, and France. Several diocesan
synods expressed themselves in favour of it, <i>e.g.</i>, that
of Arles in 1260. As we have found in other instances,
so here, it was the monasteries which prepared the way
for the adoption of the festival. Thus, for example,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
the Cistercians adopted the festival in 1270, the Cluniacs
still earlier. The introduction of the festival into each
diocese followed gradually in course of time, and it
belongs to local historians to investigate the circumstances
in each case.</p>

<p>Although Alexander II. had officially declared the
festival to be superfluous,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> it nevertheless continued to
increase in popularity in ever-widening circles. Its
adoption did not follow any uniform law, for in several
places it was observed on the last Sunday after Pentecost,
as in several dioceses of France, until on in the seventeenth
century, and here and there we find it kept with
an octave. Uniformity was at length attained when
the Roman Church under John XXII., in 1334, accepted
the festival and ordered it to be generally observed.
The Franciscan, John Peckham, Canon of Lyons, and,
from 1278 to 1292, Archbishop of Canterbury, composed
a new office. The one actually in use dates from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
times of Pius V.,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> and is one of the most beautiful in
the breviary, remarkable alike for sublimity of thought,
depth, and elegance of form. Although the first Sunday
has thus been placed in a rank by itself, the Roman
rite still continues the older enumeration of the Sundays
from Pentecost. In Germany and elsewhere it was
the custom to reckon the Sundays from Trinity, and so
each Sunday is one less than the corresponding Sunday
according to the Roman enumeration.</p>

<p>The Greeks on this Sunday commemorate All Saints,
and on this account call it All Saints’ Sunday (κυριακὴ
τῶν ἁγίων πάντων).</p>

<h5>12. <i>Corpus Christi. The Forty Hours’ Prayer. The
Festival of the Sacred Heart</i></h5>

<p>On Maundy Thursday, the consecration of the Holy
Oils and other ceremonies overshadow almost entirely
the commemoration of the important event which took
place on that day—the institution of the Holy Eucharist.
It was this fact which suggested the introduction of a
festival specially intended to commemorate that event,
as is expressly stated in the papal constitution <i>Transiturus</i>.
The introduction of this feast dates from a
comparatively late time, and its adoption is limited to
the West, although the Uniat Greeks have also partially
accepted it. The earliest trace of a special reference
to the Holy Sacrament of the altar in the public worship
of the Church is probably the appearance of the name
<i>Natalis Calicis</i>, in the Calendar of Polemius Silvius,
on the 24th March. In order to understand this entry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
it must be remembered that anciently the 25th March
was often regarded as the day on which Christ died (<i>vide
ante</i>, p. 57).</p>

<p>Divine Providence made use of a humble nun to
further the introduction of this festival. Juliana,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> born
at Retinne, near Liège, in 1193, was received as an
orphan into the cloister, and became a nun of the order
of St Augustine. She was appointed prioress of the
lazar-house of <i>Mons Cornelii</i> (Mont-Cornillon), near Liège,
where she passed the greater part of her life. When
this institution received another prior who fell out with
the authorities of Liège over some matters of administration,
Juliana was obliged to leave the lazar-house in 1240.
She took up her abode in Liège, with a kindred spirit, the
recluse Eve. She returned to Mont-Cornillon after
three years, but when fresh disagreements broke out
again, on the death of Bishop Robert († 1246), she was
compelled to leave Liège altogether. She found a refuge
with the Cistercian nuns at Salsinnes in the diocese of
Namur. But this convent was destroyed in the wars
which then disturbed the country, and Juliana was
once more destitute. She ended her life on the 5th
April 1258, as a recluse at Fosses, where she had found
a refuge, and was buried in the monastery of Villiers,
in the diocese of Namur.</p>

<p>Juliana of Retinne had been a zealous worshipper
of the Blessed Sacrament from her youth, and, from
her sixteenth year, had repeatedly seen a vision of the
disc of the full moon from which as it were a part had
been broken off. A vision of our Lord enlightened her
mind as to the signification thereof. The moon’s disc
represented the Church, which still lacked a festival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
in honour of the Blessed Sacrament, and she was to
announce this want to the world and direct all her
efforts towards the introduction of such a festival.
In 1230, she communicated her secret, on account of
which she had much to suffer, for the first time, to
John of Lausanne, Canon of St Martin at Liège, and to
some other pious and learned men, namely, Guyard,
afterwards Bishop of Cambrai, Hugo, afterwards
Cardinal Legate, the Archdeacon of Liège, James
Pantaleon of Troyes, who became Bishop of Verdun,
then Patriarch of Jerusalem, and, finally, Pope.</p>

<p>Since in those days bishops exercised the right of
appointing feasts in their own dioceses, it was of the
utmost importance that Robert de Thorete, Bishop of
Liège since 1240, was in favour of the introduction of
this festival. He gave a sympathetic hearing to the
proposals of those in favour of the feast, called a diocesan
synod in 1246, which decided in favour of its introduction,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
and proscribed for his clergy the recitation of
an office composed by Canon John, but died on the
16th October 1246, without having formally instituted
the festival. It was kept, however, as agreed upon,
by the canons of St Martin’s in the following year, and
later on it was approved by the Papal Legates, Cardinals
Hugo and Peter Capocci.</p>

<p>When James Pantaleon ascended the papal throne in
1261 as Urban IV., he received from the Bishop of Liège
a letter concerning the festival, written at the request
of the recluse Eve, who took an active part in the introduction
of the new feast. To this he wrote a favourable
reply.</p>

<p>The general adoption of the feast of Corpus Christi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
seemed now assured. Urban’s personal predilections
in its favour were further increased by the incident
of the Bohemian priest at Bolsena in 1262, and, shortly
before his death, on the 8th September 1264, he addressed
a bull<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> to all bishops and prelates in which he
directed a festival in honour of the Blessed Sacrament
should be held throughout Christendom, on the Thursday
after Trinity Sunday, and granted indulgences to all
who observed it. He commissioned moreover St Thomas
Aquinas to compose a special office, which speedily
replaced the former one.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Owing to the death of Urban,
which followed closely on the promulgation of this bull,
the affair proceeded no further, and the spread of the
festival came to a standstill. The transference of the
papal residence to Avignon caused a further delay.
Still in Liège the matter was not dropped, and the
diocesan synod of 1287 is the first which definitely
ordered that this festival should be observed.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>At length, after a long silence, Pope Clement V.,
Bertrand de Got, took up the matter once more, and
by his influence the Œcumenical Council, which he had
assembled at Vienne in 1311, authorised the festival
and enjoined its observance throughout Christendom.
For this end, he renewed the constitution of Urban IV.
in his own bull <i>Si Dominum</i>. Neither in this document,
nor in the constitution of Urban, is there any mention
of a procession of the Blessed Sacrament, but only
of a Mass and the office. The procession was a later
addition which, like the festival itself, gradually spread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
throughout different dioceses and countries. It was
not, however, altogether a novelty, for already in the
eleventh century, the Benedictines in England carried
the Blessed Sacrament on Palm Sunday in procession
outside the church.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The Corpus Christi procession, more recent than the
introduction of the feast itself, was at first a much
simpler affair than it is at present. As early as the
twelfth century, it was by no means unusual to carry
the Blessed Sacrament hidden from sight in a chalice or
pyx round the church, and a procession of this kind is
specially provided for in the ritual for Holy Week.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
The <i>Ordinarium</i> of the Church of Rouen contains
directions for the performance of such a procession, but
unfortunately the date of this document is uncertain.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
According to this, the Blessed Sacrament was carried
round the church by two priests in white chasubles,
accompanied by four choristers carrying censers. Two
other clerics carried torches, and the remainder,
vested in copes, sung various versicles and responses.
The shrine in which the Blessed Sacrament was carried
was placed in the middle of the choir, and the Sacrament
was censed by a priest accompanied by a deacon, while
the singers remained kneeling. They sang, <i>Ave, verum
corpus natum, etc.</i>, which the choir repeated still kneeling,
and then added other hymns. When this was concluded,
the archbishop was to give the blessing and commence
the Mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>The date at which the Corpus Christi procession was
introduced varies very much in different dioceses and
countries. In Cologne, it was held, for the first time,
even earlier than 1279, in the monastery of St Gereon,
when red vestments were worn.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> In 1308, it was ordered
for the parish churches of the archdiocese. The direction
of John XXII. was certainly in most cases the reason
of the feast becoming general throughout the universal
Church. The procession took place for the first time
in Worms in 1315, in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1319. In
Strassburg, Bishop John I., on 22nd July 1318, ordered
the adoption of the festival, and the recitation of the
office. The first official appearance of the festival and
procession in Treves was at the synod held under Archbishop
Baldwin in 1338; in Utrecht in 1347, in Prague
in 1355. On the other hand, it was introduced at
Würtzburg as early as 1298, before the Council of Vienne,
as appears from the statutes of the synod for that year.
At Augsburg, already in 1305, a lady of rank, Katharina
Ibsung, left all her property to the cathedral for the
due performance of the Corpus Christi procession, and
it would appear that the procession had taken place
at Augsburg as a usual thing before this.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> In the
fifteenth century the Popes Martin V. and Eugenius IV.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
encouraged the spread of the procession by granting
indulgences to those who took part—the latter especially
in his bull <i>Excellentissimus</i>, of the 26th May 1433. In
the fourteenth century, the four stations were added
at which the opening passages of the four Gospels were
sung, and in the sixteenth century these were finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
authorised.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The <i>Liber Ordinarius</i> of the Monastery of
Essen, belonging to the second half of the fourteenth
century, affords us some information concerning this
change in particular. It speaks of two processions—one
composed of the canons and without stations, which
passed out of the church and then returned; the second
of the congregation, which had four stations, at each of
which the beginning of St John’s Gospel was read and
benediction given.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>The Forty Hours’ Prayer, with exposition of the
Blessed Sacrament, owes its introduction to the Capuchin
Joseph Plantanida of Fermo. In 1556-57 he urged the
senate of Milan to take steps for observing this devotion
in all churches of Milan in turn, on account of the
war with France which was then threatening, and also
with reference to the plague which twelve years earlier
had devastated the city. The custom of spending forty
hours in prayer for some special intention had arisen
earlier than this, for a priest of Grenoble, called Antony,
for example, had established a confraternity in Milan in
1527, the members of which met four times a year for
forty hours’ adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, which,
however, was not exposed.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>At the conclusion of the octave of Corpus Christi
comes the comparatively modern festival of the Sacred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Heart of Jesus. As it is thus in point of time closely
connected with Corpus Christi, so also it resembles it in
many points. In the first place, it is essentially appointed
for the glorification of the Incarnation and the
Person of the Incarnate, and, secondly, its origin has
many points in common with that of Corpus Christi. Its
introduction is connected with the visions of the Blessed
Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647-90), which she saw
in the Convent of the Visitation at Paray-le-Monial,
during the years 1673-75. The cultus of the Sacred
Heart seems to have existed earlier as a form of private
devotion. In support of it certain passages are appealed
to in the writings of saints of earlier times, which contain
its fundamental principles. Among others, St Gertrude,
and the Carthusian James of Landsberg, are quoted.
The Blessed Margaret Mary had much to suffer in her
attempts to establish the cultus, but finally it was
introduced for the first time in 1686 at Paray-le-Monial,
or, according to others, in the Convent of the
Visitation at Moulins in 1674. The public cultus
was introduced by Charles François de Loménie,
Bishop of Coutances, who, in consequence of Margaret
Mary’s revelations, consecrated a chapel in honour
of the Sacred Heart in his seminary in 1688, and
erected a confraternity under the same title. He
was followed by Peter de Grammont, Bishop of
Besançon, who, in 1692, ordered a special Mass
with the title <i>Cordis Jesu</i>, to be printed in the
missal for his diocese, for the Friday after the
octave of Corpus Christi. The Bishop of Langres
adopted this Mass in his diocese, and finally the
Archbishop of Lyons, Primate of Gaul, at the
end of 1718 ordered the feast to be kept by the
churches under his jurisdiction. The authoritative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
recognition of the feast was given by Clement XIII.
in 1765.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<h4>B. <span class="smcap">Christmas and the Christmas Season</span></h4>

<h5>1. <i>Christmas</i></h5>

<p>Christmas, or the feast of our Lord’s birth (<i>Nativitas
Domini</i>, τὰ γένεθλια, γέννησις Χριστοῦ), has this in
common with Easter that it also is the centre of other
festivals which group themselves around it, but it
differs from Easter inasmuch as it is an immovable
feast, and so falls on a fixed day of the month. The
whole Church, and all the sects, agree in observing the
25th December as this date. As it has cost us already
some trouble to show how the determination of Easter
was arrived at, so the questions which arise in regard
to the date of Christmas are by no means few. The
answer to these questions entails a special and critical
investigation into several points of history, which,
though it may not prove interesting to everyone, will
nevertheless be full of information to those who undertake
to study it.</p>

<p>Formerly it was taken for granted that Christ had
actually been born on this day, and, accordingly, the
learned were of opinion that the Church had observed
it from the beginning as the day of His birth. Even
at the present day, it will be difficult for many to
give up this idea. But there is no Christmas among
the Christian feasts enumerated by Tertullian, Origen,
and the recently published <i>Testament of Jesus Christ</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
On the contrary, there is clear proof that even in the
fourth and fifth centuries it was unknown in some
parts of the Church, where its introduction, at a much
later period, can be proved historically. To this evidence
we shall now turn our attention, beginning with Egypt.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fifth century the learned
monk, John Cassian, betook himself to Egypt to study
the observances of the monasteries there, and later on,
between 418 and 427, he wrote down the result of his
observations in his Collations. He informs us that the
bishops of those parts at that time regarded the Epiphany
as our Lord’s birth-day, and that there was no separate
festival in honour of the latter. He calls this the
“ancient custom.”<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>This old custom, although generally observed at that
time in Egypt, had soon to give place to a new one.
For under Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria, Bishop Paul
of Emesa, while on a visit to him, preached on the
festival of our Lord’s nativity, and the date on which
this happened was the 29th Chijak, or 25th December,
in the year 432. Christmas, then, had been introduced
into Egypt before this time, that is to say, between
418 and 432,<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> and from then onwards it was firmly
established, as the existing Calendars of subsequent date
show.</p>

<p>The learned Bishop Epiphanius of Salamis lived
in Cyprus at the end of the fourth century. In his
answer to the Alogoi he gives the chronology of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Lord’s life, according to which the 6th January is the
day of our Lord’s birth, and the 8th November the day
of His baptism in Jordan. For him the Epiphany was
plainly the festival of Christ’s nativity.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>The old custom was still in force in Jerusalem about
385. Our Lord’s birth was celebrated there with great
rejoicings, not on the 25th December, but on the 6th
January. For according to the evidence of the Pilgrim
from Bordeaux, the festival on which the gospel was
read, giving the account of the Presentation of Christ
in the Temple and His meeting with Simeon and Anna—Candlemas
Day—was celebrated forty days after
the Epiphany and not forty days after Christmas.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
Epiphany must then have been the festival of the
Nativity. In another passage, where the same pilgrim
has reason to name the chief festivals of the year, she
mentions as such only Epiphany and Easter.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> And
so at that time there was no special festival of Christmas
observed in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Among the witnesses for the old custom, we find
Ephrem Syrus, who informs us that, in his time, the church
of Mesopotamia commemorated the Incarnation of the
Son of God on the thirteenth day after the winter
solstice, in the month when the light begins to increase,
<i>i.e.</i> on the 6th January.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the festival of the 25th
December, as Christ’s birth-day, was entirely unknown
to the ancient churches of Armenia and Mesopotamia,
and remained so partially until on in the fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
century.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> In the most of the great churches of the
East, on the contrary, this feast was introduced during
the last decades of the fourth century, in others somewhat
later. Most interesting particulars concerning
the introduction of Christmas in various localities are
extant, and, since they refer to its <i>introduction</i>, we
are safe in concluding, from the historical evidence
before us, that these churches had not celebrated
Christmas until then. This is the case with regard to
Constantinople.</p>

<p>The second capital of the empire had long been a
stronghold of Arianism, so that the orthodox had
dwindled down to a mere handful, and no longer
possessed a church of their own in the city. During this
period Christmas was certainly not celebrated in Constantinople.
Not till after the death of Valens, and
the elevation of Theodosius the Great to the empire
(19th January 379), did the Catholics breathe freely
once more. They received as bishop Gregory of
Nazianzus, formerly Bishop of Sasima, but then living
in retirement at Seleucia in Isauria. He began his
labours as a stranger and sojourner in a small private
chapel which he called the Anastasia. Here, on the
25th December 379 or 380, Christmas was celebrated
for the first time in Constantinople, as he himself
informs us, and on this occasion he delivered his thirty-eighth
homily.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Thus one of the first acts of the
restorer of Catholicism in the capital was the introduction
of the new festival. In the above homily indeed
he says nothing about its being celebrated for the first
time, but in the following homily (c. 14), when speaking
of the previous Christmas, he calls himself its originator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
(ἔξαρχος). Gregory’s activity in the capital was unfortunately
of short duration. Soon after the meeting
of the second General Council, in 381, he was compelled
through the intrigues of his opponents to retire from his
post.</p>

<p>It would not be impossible, and certainly would not
be surprising, if Gregory’s expulsion also imperilled
his new institution, and that the festival of Christ’s
Nativity would have to be re-introduced. At any rate,
a late and not very reliable writer, though one not to be
passed over in this connection, speaks of the emperor
Honorius as having been the means of introducing the
feast of Christmas at Constantinople. On the occasion
of a visit to Constantinople he persuaded his mother and
his brother Arcadius to celebrate the feast of Christmas,
and in the Roman manner.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> This must have taken
place after the year 395.</p>

<p>In Cappadocia the separation of the two feasts,
Epiphany and Christmas, had been effected in 380,
at least as far as Nyssa was concerned. For Gregory
of Nyssa, in his funeral oration on Basil, speaks of the
festival of Christ’s birth as well established.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> He says
the same in his two sermons for the feast of St Stephen.</p>

<p>With regard to the circumstances connected with the
introduction of the festival at Antioch, we are fully
informed by St Chrysostom in a sermon he preached there
on the 20th December 386.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>The festival had been known in Antioch for about
ten years already, and a certain party there among the
faithful were in the habit of celebrating it publicly,
but its official introduction was first effected by Bishop
Flavian, who was seconded in this by St John
Chrysostom, recently ordained priest in the February
of the same year. Chrysostom began his priestly
activity with a course of sermons against the thorough-going
Arians—the Anomæans. These discourses treat
of the nature of God, His incomprehensibility, and
triune personality, but the preacher had to interrupt
the course from time to time in order to deal with
other matters affecting the faithful themselves, such
as their superstitious respect for, and imitation of,
the Jews and their customs. Some went so far as to
regard oaths taken in the synagogue as more sacred
and binding than those taken in the church. Many
Christians observed the Jewish festivals as well as their
own. On this account Chrysostom departed from his
first subject and directed his first four sermons against
the Jews. Then his eloquence was directed to the task
of winning over the faithful of Antioch to the observance
of Christmas.</p>

<p>It was on the festival of the Antiochene martyr
Philogonius that he announced to his hearers that on
the following 25th December Christmas would be celebrated
for the first time in the Church of Antioch.
The day had been observed in the West from the
beginning (ἄνωθεν), but only during the last ten years
had the knowledge of it penetrated to Antioch. For
his own part, he had for a long time made his prayer in
secret that the festival should be kept also in Antioch.
He had found many, especially of the lower orders,
in favour of it, but many, on the other hand, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
opposed, and so the introduction of the festival had
been delayed.</p>

<p>The efforts of the great preacher were crowned
with success. A very large number of the faithful
were present in the church when the new festival was
celebrated. The sermon which Chrysostom delivered
on the occasion has happily come down to us.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> In
the introduction he says he wished to speak to them
himself concerning the festival over which there had been
so much controversy in Antioch. Some considered it a
mere innovation, but others knew that it was observed
in the West from Thrace to Cadiz. This last assertion
was an exaggeration, as the next words of Chrysostom
themselves show. He says he proposes to commend the
feast to the devotion of his hearers on three grounds:
first, because the feast has spread with remarkable
rapidity, and has met with so much favour in all directions;<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
secondly, because the time of the census taken
in the year of Christ’s birth can be determined by ancient
documents preserved in Rome; thirdly, the year of our
Lord’s birth can be computed from the time of the
angel’s appearance to Zachary in the Temple. Zachary,
as High Priest, had entered into the Holy of Holies
on the Day of Atonement. The Jewish Day of Atonement
fell in September. Six months afterwards the
angel came to Mary, and nine months later Christ was
born, <i>i.e.</i> in December. Chrysostom concludes with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
an attack upon those who do not believe in the incarnation
of the Son of God.</p>

<p>All this, however, as far as the determination of the
date is concerned, rests upon an insecure foundation.
Since Zachary was only an ordinary priest, and not the
High Priest, his entry into the Holy of Holies cannot
therefore be identified with that of the High Priest
on the Day of Atonement. But this is of little importance,
if on independent grounds these calculations
could still point to the month of December, though the
25th need not on this account have been the precise
day on which our Lord was born.</p>

<p>When we consider the facts, we see that it was no
mere accident that Christmas began to be celebrated
in the East just at this particular period, and that
its introduction was due to the influence of the great
men whom we have named.</p>

<p>It was the moment when Catholics began successfully
to repel Arianism; it was just those who attacked
Arianism with most vigour and success who promoted
the spread of the new festival in the East. We must
add to this the evidence afforded by secular enactments.
Neither the laws of Valentinian II., nor the revisers
of the <i>Codex Theodosianus</i> in 438, nor the <i>Breviarium
Alaricianum</i> of 506, regard the 25th December as a
festival established by law. It was made to appear for
the first time as such by Tribonianus in the <i>Codex
Justinianus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> From these additional facts, we gather
that Christmas was of later introduction in the Church
than Easter or Whitsunday. In such matters secular
law generally follows the lead of ecclesiastical law.
If Christmas had been celebrated in the Church from
the beginning, one can see no reason why it should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
not have enjoyed equal privileges with Easter and Whitsunday.
Still there was a law of the Emperor Arcadius
as early as 400 which included Christmas among the
days on which at least the games of the circus were
forbidden.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Chrysostom, in the sermon referred to above, states
plainly that, at the time when the attempt was being
made to introduce the festival in the East, it was
already celebrated in Rome. Our attention is thus
naturally directed to Rome, and it will be interesting
to learn how long it had been so observed there. This
question we must now consider more fully.</p>

<p>John, Bishop of Nicæa, informs us that the Roman
Church had begun under Pope Julius I. (337-352) to
celebrate the birth of our Lord on the 25th December.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
This pope, with the assistance of the writings of Josephus,
had ascertained that Christ was born on the 25th
December. John of Nicæa then recurs substantially
to the reckoning which we have already produced from
Chrysostom, according to which the appearance of
the angel to Zachary in the Temple happened on the
23rd September and the Annunciation on the 25th
March. From these data it followed as a matter of
course that the 25th December was the day of Christ’s
birth. John had gained this information from an
alleged correspondence between Cyril of Jerusalem
and Julius, from which he quotes. But this correspondence
is certainly not authentic, as will appear from one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
of the facts quoted from it further on.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> But the fact
that it cannot stand the test of criticism does not prove
the spuriousness of the treatise of John of Nicæa in itself,
nor the incorrectness of everything else contained in it.</p>

<p>When we turn to the authentic evidence for the
practice of the Roman Church on this point, our attention
is at once arrested by one document which is quoted
under very different names—<i>Anonymus Cuspiniani</i>,
<i>Catalogus Bucherianus</i>, the Calendar of Furius Philocalus,
or the Chronographer of 354. These different
ways of quoting the same document are apt to lead to
confusion. They are due to the fact that from time
to time different scholars have published larger or
smaller portions of the document, without ever placing
it before the public in its entirety. The different
portions of which it is composed are of a rather heterogeneous
character, and, accordingly, as each student
was interested in this or that portion, he published as
much of it as concerned his own studies, leaving the
remainder unnoticed. In order to form a correct
judgment of the evidential value of this document,
and the importance of the facts recorded in it, it will
be well at this point to describe it more particularly,
although to do so may lead us away from our main
subject.</p>

<p>Briefly, we have to do with a collection of chronological
data belonging to the time of Constantine,
in which the unknown compiler collected together from
official sources all kinds of chronological and historical
notices, such as might be useful for people in official
positions. His object was to supply them with a compendium
of all that might be of practical assistance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
to them. John Cuspinianus (1473-1529) was the
first to make use of this work, because he recognised
that the list of Roman consuls contained in it is the
most correct that has come down to us. In his <i>Commentarius
de Consulibus Romanis</i>, published at Basel
after his death, in 1552, a part of the work is printed.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>Other students then edited such portions as related
to the special studies they had in hand, such as Onuphrius
Panvinius, Ægidius Boucher, S.J.,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Lambeck, Henschen,
Cardinal Noris, Eccard, Preller, and especially Roncalli.
Finally, in the transactions of the “Akademie der
Wissenschaften” of Saxony for 1850, Mommsen printed
almost the whole of it with the exception of the later
portions. A collection of the allegorical illustrations of
the document, as far as they exist, has also been published,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
and thus at length this remarkable document
has been placed within the reach of all to whom it may
be of interest.</p>

<p>The different sections therein contained are partly
of ecclesiastical and Christian origin, and partly secular
and heathen. Of purely ecclesiastical origin, in addition
to the table for calculating Easter, are the <i>Depositio
Episcoporum</i>, the <i>Depositio Martyrum</i>, and the list of
popes. The remaining sections fall into two classes:
they are either entirely heathen, or they have interpolations
of a Christian and ecclesiastical character. This is
especially the case with the lists of consuls. Up to 753
<span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span> they contain merely the names of the consuls, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
notices of the dictators; from 753 <span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span> to 55 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> four
ecclesiastical notices have been interpolated, but none
from thence onwards. These four notices relate to the
date of Christ’s birth and death, the arrival of the
Apostles Peter and Paul in Rome, and their death
there. These notices, naturally, did not originally
form part of the lists of consuls. Who added them?
Philocalus himself or someone else?</p>

<p>Since the list of consuls contains ecclesiastical
interpolations, it is all the more remarkable that none
have been added to the Calendar. Where else would
we more naturally look for them, and where could they
have been more easily introduced? Why did not
Philocalus set down the birth of Christ here under the
25th December, the <i>Natalis Invicti</i>, since he considered
it of sufficient importance to be interpolated into the
lists of consuls, with which it is out of keeping?</p>

<p>But if, it is objected, the date of Christ’s birth is also
given in the <i>Depositio Martyrum</i>, let us examine this
document more closely. As the title indicates, it
contains only the days of the death and burial of Roman
martyrs and other martyrs venerated in Rome in the
earliest ages, <i>e.g.</i> Cyprian, Perpetua, Felicitas. To
these there are added two exceptions: VIII. Kal. Jan.
(the birth of Christ at Bethlehem) and VIII. Kal. Mart.
(the feast of St Peter’s Chair). Neither of these belong
in any sense to a <i>Depositio Martyrum</i>, and on this
account, De Rossi wished to change the title of the
document to <i>Feriale Ecclesiæ Romanæ</i>. But in this
he was mistaken. The MSS. have the title <i>Depositio
Martyrum</i> alone, and to change it would be arbitrary.
The two days mentioned above, the 25th December
and the 22nd February, must rather be struck out as
later additions which do not belong to the document.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>That such entries do not appear in the Calendar is
explained, in my opinion, by the fact that soon afterwards
succeeding emperors forbade the games of the
circus and energetically suppressed heathen customs.
When this had been done, the Calendar would no longer
be of any practical use, and so it would not be worth
while to make alterations in it. The other chronological
pieces, however, had a permanent value, and it naturally
occurred to those who used them later on to adapt
them to the altered circumstances of the time.</p>

<p>We must now examine more minutely the notice
of Christ’s birth given us in this document. It runs as
follows: <i>I p. Chr. Cæsare et Paulo sat. XIII. Hoc cons.
Dns. ihs. XPC natus est VIII. Kal. Jan. de ven. luna
XV.</i><a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Which means, Christ was born during the consulship
of C. Cæsar Augustus and L. Æmilius Paulus
(754 <span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span>), on the 25th December, which was a Friday,
on the fifteenth day of the new moon.</p>

<p>This notice gives rise to several questions. First
of all the Epact is not correct, as according to our tables
it ought to be 11.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> But this need not detain us, as two
or three peculiarities of this kind are to be met with in
this list of the consuls. The error concerning the day
of the week is more important. To expose this error
we need only give the dominical letters for the years
in question:—</p>

<p>The compiler of this chronology might have set down
the birth of Christ in either 754 or 753 <span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span> 754 is a
possible year, although the 25th December 753 is more
probable, yet in either case the day of the week would be
wrong. In 752, the 25th December fell on Thursday,
but since 753 was a leap year, the dominical letter
advances two places, and Friday is passed over. At the
same time, there has been a fairly constant tradition that
the 25th of December fell on a Wednesday in the year of
Christ’s birth. In any case, the notice that the 25th
December fell, in this year, on a Friday is based on a mistaken
reckoning. This notice, then, does not represent a
tradition, but is merely the result of a calculation which
unfortunately is incorrect. Consequently the whole
interpolation is undeserving of credit. We now pass
on to a second point.</p>

<p>While all writers before 354 fix the year of Christ’s
birth by the year of the Emperor’s reign, here, for the
first time, it is fixed by the year of the consuls. This
is a marked departure from the original usage. The
forty-first or forty-second year of Augustus correctly
converted into a consular year would have run:
<i>Augusto XIII. et Silvano conss.</i> or <i>Lentulo et Messalino</i>,
which would also be the year 751 or 752 <span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span>, according
as the year of the emperor is taken as “<i>effektiv</i>” or not,
<i>i.e.</i> according as one places Christ’s birth in the first or
second half of the year.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, when the chronographer dates the year of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Christ’s birth in the consulship of “Cæsar and Paulus”
(754 <span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span>), he anticipates the Dionysian era some two
hundred years before Dionysius, and, further, when, in
accordance with a very ancient tradition, he places the
year of Christ’s death in the consulship of the “<i>duo
gemini</i>” (29 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), he thus only allows twenty-eight
and a quarter years for Christ’s earthly life, while St
Luke (iii. 23) speaks of Him as having wellnigh thirty
full years. Whoever he may have been who inserted
this notice under the consulship of Cæsar and Paulus in
the chronology, he certainly made a mistake. He also
stands alone in placing Christ’s birth in the year 754
<span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span>, for the writers and annalists who wrote at a later
date, such as Sulpicius Severus, Orosius, Prosper,
Hydatius, and even Cassiodorus, give other dates.</p>

<p>The anonymous compiler of this chronology differs
also, both as to contents and form, from those who
preceded him. While Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria,
Tertullian, the pseudo-Cyprian, etc., fix the year of
Christ’s birth by a year of the emperor, <i>i.e.</i> the forty-first
or forty-second of Augustus, it is given in this
document in the form of a consular year, and while the
former give 751-752 <span class="allsmcap">U.C.</span> as the year, the latter gives
754. All this creates great difficulty in accepting the
evidence of the compiler.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>We must now deal with the day of the month given
in the chronology, the 25th December, which, strictly
speaking, alone is of importance in connection with the
end we have in view, although it cannot well be separated
from the previous question as to the year. It has
recently been thought that Hippolytus afforded some
very early evidence on this point, owing to a passage in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
his commentary on Daniel bearing upon the subject.
However, this hope has proved deceptive,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> since the
passage in Hippolytus proves to be the addition of a
much later hand; we are thus left with the chronology
of 354 as the earliest evidence for placing the birth of
Christ on the 25th December.</p>

<p>The result of our investigation of this compilation,
made up of historical, chronological, and other materials,
proves that the compiler, in collecting his materials
in 354, added to the lists of consuls, which naturally he
did not draw up himself, the notice that Christ was born
under these particular consuls on the 25th December,
because it was at that time the generally accepted date.
It could only be widely accepted, when the festival
of Christ’s birth had already been celebrated on this
day, not recently but during a considerable period. It
is very improbable that it had just been introduced by
any one person in particular, such as the Bishop of Rome,
for the first years of the reign of Liberius were very
troubled and ill suited for the introduction of so important
an innovation. Moreover, history shows that a
thing like this cannot be done all at once by a stroke
of the pen, or at the will of an individual, even though he
be the Bishop of Rome, but is rather the outcome of a
long period of preparation.</p>

<p>The compiler clearly bears witness that Christmas
existed already in Rome in 354, but not that it had then
been only recently introduced there, still less that Christ
was actually born on the 25th December. This statement
is unsupported by evidence prior to 354, for the
passage in Hippolytus is an interpolation, the <i>Depositio
Martyrum</i> and the <i>Depositio Episcoporum</i> have been
worked over by the hand of the same compiler, who may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
have made additions to them to the same effect without
prejudice to their original contents.</p>

<p>Nevertheless attempts were made to maintain the
25th December on other grounds. As we have seen,
Chrysostom made an attempt of this kind, and even in
recent times there have been people who repeated the
attempt, without falling into the mistake of making
Zachary a High Priest. They reckoned as follows:—when
the angel announced to Zachary his son’s birth,
the course of Abia, to which Zachary belonged, was
performing the service of the Temple.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> At the dedication
of the Temple under Solomon it was arranged that
the twenty-four priestly families mentioned in 1 Paral.
xxiv. 7-13 should relieve one another in orderly succession
throughout the year, each being responsible for
the Temple services for a week. The first course was
that of Joiarib, the course of Abia being the eighth.
After the return from exile, these courses of priests were
re-established, and continued to discharge their functions
as before, so soon as the new Temple had been dedicated.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
According to the assertion of Josephus,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> this arrangement
survived to his own time, and was consequently
in existence at the commencement of the Christian era.</p>

<p>Since the dedication of both Temples took place in
autumn, it has been calculated that the course of Abia
must have been on duty in the year of the Lord’s birth
on the day of Atonement, which fell at that season.
This was arrived at by calculating both forwards and
backwards from the destruction of Jerusalem. But
in the former case, beginning with the restoration of the
Temple, the calculation is thrown into confusion by the
fact that twice during the existence of the second Temple
the regular performance of divine service was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
interrupted.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> In the time of the Machabees, under
Antiochus Epiphanes, the interruption lasted for three
years. In this case what was to be done? The succession
of the courses might be resumed after the interruption
as if nothing had happened, or, at the re-establishment
of worship, that course might undertake
duty whose turn it was to serve at that particular time
of the year, or, finally, one might start afresh with the
course of Joiarib. In all these cases it would be said
that the ancient order had been maintained, but which
of the three possibilities just mentioned was actually
chosen is not told us.</p>

<p>Even if it were told us, the reckoning would still be
without solid foundation. For each course of priests
served in turn twice a year, leaving however eighteen
days, or in a leap-year twenty-nine, still to be accounted
for. The difficulty is not lessened by the fact that during
the week of the Passover, several courses were on duty
in the Temple at once. Granted that the course of Abia
was on service in spring and again in autumn, St Luke
unfortunately does not inform us at what season of the
year the angel appeared to Zachary, or even if this
event happened during the Passover, when the course of
Abia might quite possibly have been on duty as well.</p>

<p>We are no better off if we begin our reckoning from
the destruction of Jerusalem, when the course of Joiarib
is said to have been on duty,<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> for again we do not know
in what season of the year the angel appeared. If we
take the autumn as certain, then we assume what
must be proved. Even if the difficulties are fewer in
this method of proceeding, on account of the shortness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
of the period, it still remains a question whether, when
the services of the Temple came to an end in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70,
they ceased on the 8th Gorpiæos, when the citadel of
Jerusalem was taken, or on the 10th Lous, the day of the
destruction of the Temple itself.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> It is impossible by
these means to prove that the 25th December is really
the day of Our Lord’s birth.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>It follows from this that there is no sort of existing
proof that the Redeemer was actually born on this day.
We may add, moreover, that even when this opinion
had met with acceptance from many, and in times when
Christmas had become one of the popular festivals, there
were not wanting some here and there who expressed
doubt on the question. This is the case in an ancient
sermon on Christmas included among the spurious
writings of St Jerome: “Whether our Lord Jesus Christ
was baptized to-day, or whether He was born, has given
rise to different opinions in the world, and according to
the different traditions different views are maintained.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
Although this sermon is incorrectly attributed to St
Jerome, it nevertheless certainly belongs to his time, for
it refers to the gilded temples of Rome (<i>aurata capitolia</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>What then was the amount of knowledge possessed
by antiquity concerning the true day of Christ’s birth?
It may not be out of place to attempt to answer this
question. There are only a few passages in which the
oldest writers in the Church refer to the matter, but from
these it is easy to see that, even in the earliest times,
nothing was known for certain, and that those who were
interested in the question did not agree among themselves.
This was the case, for example, in Alexandria in
the second century. A party existed there who regarded
the 25th of the Egyptian month Pachon (<i>i.e.</i>
20th May) as the day of our Lord’s birth. The Basilidians
of Alexandria, however, observed it on the 15th
Tybi (<i>i.e.</i> 10th January), and passed the preceding
night in devotional readings. The majority celebrated
Christ’s birth on the 11th Tybi (<i>i.e.</i> 6th January).<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>In a treatise of the third century formerly attributed
to St Cyprian, which deals with kindred subjects, a very
different view appears. The anonymous writer of this
treatise (<i>De Pascha Computus</i>), which was composed in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 243, inclines to the view that the 28th March was
the true day of Christ’s birth,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and, contemporary with
this, Hippolytus sets it down on the 25th of the same
month, provided this is the correct interpretation of the
inscription on his statue. In the fourth and fifth
centuries, the view became prevalent that Christ was
born on the 25th December, and St Augustine uses
expressions which seem to imply he was of this opinion.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>The four gospels contain nothing in support of any of
these dates. Their authors attached no importance to
this point, although their aim in writing was to give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
information concerning our Lord’s life, and, even if the
date was known to them, we must allow for the difficulty
of fixing dates of past events in accordance with Jewish
modes of reckoning time. However, it is possible
that our Lord was born at the beginning of winter. The
census which took place at the time of His birth, rendered
it necessary that the inhabitants of Judæa should be
enrolled each in his own city. On this account, the
Roman authorities would see that the census was made
at a season when agricultural work had ceased, such as
the late autumn or early winter. There can have been
no ecclesiastical tradition concerning the date of the
Nativity, since in the earliest times it was commemorated
by no special festival. The Epiphany, which commemorated
several events, took the place of such a
festival.</p>

<p>These are the difficulties which stand in the way of
accepting the 25th December as the actual date of the
Nativity, and they must be taken into account by any
one who desires to form a judgment for himself on this
matter. The other questions relating to the same point
are more easily disposed of.</p>

<p>Whether the accepted date is correct or not, we find
it definitely set down by the chronographer of 354,
who directly states that Christ was born on the 25th
December (<i>natus est octavo Kalendas Januarias</i>), while
it follows indirectly from his words that this day was
solemnly observed as the day of His nativity. The
Calendar ends with the year 354, and accordingly
Christmas was observed then in the same way as at
present. The year 354 brings us within the pontificate
of Liberius, and it is just in his pontificate that we find
further authentic evidence concerning the feast.</p>

<p>During his pontificate Liberius gave the veil to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
Marcellina, an elder sister of St Ambrose. This took
place on the day of our Lord’s birth (<i>Natalis Salvatoris</i>),
and on this occasion Liberius delivered a sermon preserved
for us by Ambrose in his <i>De Virginitate</i>. In this
work he recalls to his sister’s memory what the Pope had
said: “When thou sealedst thy vow of virginity in St
Peter’s by changing thy habit on the birth-day of the
Redeemer—on what more fitting day could it have taken
place than that on which the Virgin (Mary) brought
forth her child—and in the presence of many of God’s
hand-maidens who strove for thy companionship, he
(Liberius) said, ‘Thou hast desired excellent espousals,
my daughter. Thou seest what a crowd of people have
come together to celebrate the birth-day of thy Bridegroom,
and that no one goes away from hence unnourished.
He it is who, when invited to the marriage,
changed water into wine. He will vouchsafe the true
secrets of virginity to thee, who until now hast been
subject to the beggarly elements of nature. He it is
who, with five loaves and two fishes, satisfied four
thousand men in the wilderness.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> He could have
satisfied more had more been there. Finally, He has
invited still more to thine espousals, not to give them
barley-bread, but a Body from heaven.’”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>Liberius here represents taking the vows of religion
under the familiar figure of a marriage. The marriage
feast always forms part of every marriage, and accordingly
it was the duty of the Bridegroom whom Marcellina
had chosen to provide one. He had changed
water into wine and fed thousands with a few loaves, but
now He feeds a still greater number with His mystical
Body in the Holy Eucharist. This is the thought
running through the Pope’s address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>St Ambrose does not inform us of the year in which
the ceremony took place at which Liberius spoke the
above words. Liberius had been elected bishop of
Rome (17th May 352) in troublous times under the
Emperor Constantius, a strong Arian. As he refused
to communicate with the Eusebius and protected St
Athanasius, he was banished to Berœa at the end of 355,
where he was compelled to remain until 357. The
Archdeacon Felix, relying on the Emperor’s support,
allowed himself to be consecrated bishop in his stead,
but found no following in Rome. On this account,
Constantius consented to the recall of the lawful bishop,
and Liberius resided in Rome for the remainder of his
pontificate, and died there in 366.</p>

<p>It is more probable that Marcellina’s clothing with
the religious habit took place during the latter part of
this pontificate. For according to the received opinion,
St Ambrose was born about the year 340,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and thus in
353 he would have been only thirteen years old, and
although his sister was older, yet in 353 she would not
have been twenty-five, the canonical age for taking the
veil.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Still it is not impossible that the ceremony and
the address of Liberius took place between 352 and 354,
and at any rate this much is certain that it took place
on the 25th December and not on the Epiphany (6th
January), according to the view formerly held.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
is no evidence that the Epiphany was observed in Rome,
as it had been in the East, as the day of Christ’s birth,
and Liberius in this address does not say that the commemoration
of the miracles of the loaves and of the
changing water into wine was being celebrated precisely
on the day of Marcellina’s taking the veil, <i>i.e.</i> on the
day of the Saviour’s birth (<i>Natalis Salvatoris</i>). These
things were alluded to only because of their connection
with the train of thought followed by Liberius in his
address.</p>

<p>Nothing can be gathered from the words of Liberius
as to when Christmas was first observed in Rome on the
25th December. In any case, it did not come into
existence suddenly, but would require time, and, like
other festivals, a considerable period would have to
elapse before it became general and gained official
recognition. Contemporary evidence on this point is
wanting; one ancient witness, unfortunately not altogether
reliable, speaks of Julius I. and not Liberius as
the originator of Christmas.</p>

<p>We must now conclude by giving the view we have
arrived at. In Rome a distinctive custom had arisen of
celebrating Christ’s nativity on the 25th December,
while in other quarters it was celebrated on the 6th
January. How this was brought about must remain
a matter for conjecture. It has been thought that in
some places heathen festivals of various kinds were kept
in the month of December; in particular, the Kikellia<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
was kept at Alexandria on the 25th December, in Bostra
and Pella, a festival of local observance,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and in Rome,
the Saturnalia began on the 17th December and lasted
until the 23rd.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> It is only natural that the winter
solstice should give rise to a festival, and find its place
marked in the Calendar of Feasts. Indeed, in the Roman
Calendar of much later date—that of Philocalus—the
25th December is marked as the birth-day of the unconquerable
Sun-God (<i>Natalis Solis Invicti</i>).</p>

<p>Since on the 21st December the sun reaches its lowest
point, and then begins once more to rise higher in the
heavens, man, in his simplicity, marked the day on which
this change in the sun became perceptible as the new
birth or birth-day of the sun, the invincible Sun-God.
What was more natural for the Christians of that age
than to connect this obvious natural event with the
thought of the nativity of Him who is the Light of the
World! Even if the Holy Scriptures had not suggested
this idea, it must have presented itself to the
Christian mind. The comparison of Christ with the
sun, and of His work with the victory of light over
darkness, frequently appears in the writings of the
Fathers. St Cyprian<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> spoke of Christ as the true sun
(<i>sol verus</i>). St Ambrose<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> says precisely, “He is our
new sun” (<i>Hic sol novus noster</i>). Similar figures are
employed by Gregory of Nazianzus, Zeno of Verona,
Leo the Great, Gregory the Great, etc.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Every child knows that Simeon addressed the new-born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Messias as “a light to the revelation of the Gentiles,”
and, since the Messias is also called by the Prophets the
light in the darkness and the Sun of Justice, it is easy
to see how such expressions passed into the Church’s
liturgy for this festival.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> It was natural for the Romans
to set down the birth-day of this new Sun on the day
marked of old time in their Calendar as a <i>Natalis Solis</i>,
and observed as a festival by all the heathen inhabitants
of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The choice of the day cannot be due to the
desire to supplant the heathen festival, for it was not a
festival of any special importance. But the similarity
between the natural fact (the solstice) and the revolution
in the spiritual sphere (Christ’s nativity), was sufficient
to suggest the idea. It was not necessary to wait for the
time of Constantine in order to hit upon this idea.</p>

<p>We must now return once more to the usages of the
Church of Jerusalem and the festival observed there.
The 6th January, indeed, was called in Jerusalem
Epiphany, nevertheless the nativity of Christ formed
an especially prominent feature of the commemoration.</p>

<p>A detailed description of the function is given in
Silvia’s diary. Unfortunately the beginning is missing,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
and the account opens with the return of the great
procession which took place annually from Jerusalem
to Bethlehem the evening before the feast. The next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
morning, the procession returned to Jerusalem and
proceeded to the Church of the Anastasis, which was
richly decorated. The monks remained all night in the
church at Bethlehem, which, all through the octave,
remained in festal array.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> A procession to Bethlehem,
on the Epiphany would have no meaning, if the
baptism of Christ was the only event commemorated
at that feast, for this, of course, took place in the
Jordan. In Jerusalem, as in the other Eastern
Churches, no special Christmas festival had been as
yet instituted, still at the commencement of the fifth
century there were some who regarded the Epiphany as
the day of Christ’s nativity in the flesh, although, as
St Jerome says,<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> the Son of God did not reveal Himself
in flesh but rather concealed Himself. Indeed, if we
are to believe Cosmas Indicopleustes, who lived in the
middle of the sixth century, the nativity of Christ was
commemorated at Jerusalem, and there only on the
Epiphany—“a superstitious fancy,” as he calls it.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it has been stated that Bishop
Juvenal (425-458), who obtained for the Church of
Jerusalem patriarchal rank, introduced the feast of
Christ’s birth.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps it was specially difficult to establish this
festival in Jerusalem on the 25th December because
another festival was already observed there on that day—the
commemoration of David and the Apostle St
James.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Their commemoration, along with that of St<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Joseph, is kept both by the Greek Church and the
Church of Jerusalem on the Sunday before Christmas.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>A document already referred to, dating from the end
of the ninth or beginning of the tenth century, affords
an interesting proof of the manner in which these
matters which we have placed before the reader were
regarded at a later date. John, Bishop of Nicæa, who
flourished about the year 900, endeavoured to induce the
Armenians to adopt the 25th December as the day of
Christ’s birth, and set down in an elaborate treatise the
reasons he thought calculated to influence them. This
composition is especially interesting because in it the
introduction of Christmas is ascribed to a particular
individual, none other than Pope Julius I. (337-352).
Bishop Cyril of Jerusalem (348-386) is said to have
corresponded with him on this question. Even if, from
point of view of dates, this were not impossible, the
letter of Cyril would in itself give rise to suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
For Cyril would have been more likely to introduce or
establish the feast on another day, while it is historically
certain it was not yet observed in Jerusalem in 385.</p>

<p>In this pretended letter, Cyril alleges as a reason for
transferring the feast to a different day from the Epiphany,
that it is impossible for the inhabitants of Jerusalem
to keep both feasts on the same day with befitting
solemnity. Bethlehem lies three miles west, and the
Jordan fifteen miles east of Jerusalem. It is stated in
this letter that a procession went to both places on the
same day, and so it was impossible for the clergy to
accompany both. The often quoted diary of the Gallic
Pilgrim<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> shows us that the procession to Bethlehem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
actually took place, but she is silent about a procession
to the Jordan. This is first mentioned by Gregory of
Tours in the sixth century.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> It only was possible when
the Nativity had been transferred to another day. The
writer of the letter has antedated a later practice and
certainly was not Bishop Cyril of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The manner in which this letter brings forth evidence
in favour of choosing the 25th December for the Nativity
of Christ is also interesting. Titus, says the supposed
Cyril in this letter to Pope Julius, had carried off all
the books of the Jews to Rome after the destruction of
Jerusalem. There they still remain, and Julius might
make a search to see if the true birth-day of Christ cannot
be discovered.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Julius then discovered from the writings
of Josephus that Zachary had seen the vision of
the angel in the Temple in the seventh month, on the
Day of Atonement, which on that occasion had fallen
on the 23rd September. On that day his son, St John
the Baptist, was conceived, who was born on the 24th
June following, but Christ, according to St Luke i. 36,
was born six months later, on the 25th December.</p>

<p>As regards the liturgical celebration of the feast, the
oldest sermons on the <i>Nativitas Domini</i> which have come
down to us, are those of Zeno of Verona († 380).<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> They
are purely moral exhortations, and throw no light upon
the date of the feast. He has no sermon for the Epiphany,
and it may be inferred he did not observe it or
that it was identified with the Nativity.</p>

<p>The representation of the crib on a side-altar or some
other conspicuous place in the church is a special feature
of the Christmas festival at the present day. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
remains in the church until Epiphany, or even to the
2nd February. The Christmas crib dates back to St
Francis of Assisi, who, with the permission of the Pope,
set up in 1223 for the first time a representation of the
child Jesus in the manger.</p>

<p>It is also the custom to celebrate three Masses, of
which the first, according to the ancient use, commenced
at midnight. As the words of the Mass show, this first
Mass commemorates the eternal generation of the Son
from the Father, the second commemorates His Incarnation
and birth into this world, the third His birth
through grace, in the hearts of sinners. The Gelasian
sacramentary mentions the <i>trina celebratio</i>. The custom
is one which reaches back to early Christian times.
Gregory the Great mentions it in <i>Hom. viii.</i> in <i>Evang.</i>
The Leonine sacramentary contains nine different
formularies for Christmas, but the other western rites,
including the Mozarabic, have only one Mass for the
feast. The Menology of Basil Porphyrogenitus gives
the flight of Mary into Egypt on the 26th December,
and St Stephen only on the following day.</p>

<p>Since the 25th December was only chosen for reasons
of a more or less accidental and external character, so
too the days which immediately follow—St Stephen,
St John the Evangelist, and the Holy Innocents—have
no real connection with Christmas, although they are of
very ancient institution. The 26th December was
already a special festival in the fourth century, as appears
from the sermons of St Augustine (<i>Sermo</i> 314, c. 1),
though he knows nothing of the two following days.
The 220th sermon, which celebrates the Holy Innocents,
is spurious.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> They appear, however, in the African<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
Calendar of the sixth century. On the Innocents’ Day
in the Middle Ages the schoolboys used to elect a bishop
who was nothing more than their leader, and the ceremony
was quite harmless. For this ceremony, as well
as for the crib and other popular customs still practised,
the reader is referred to Heuser’s elaborate articles in
the <i>Kirchenlexikon</i>, iv²., 1395-1436.</p>

<p>The introduction of Christmas and its appointment
on the 25th December brought about the establishment
of three other festivals: 1. the feast of the <i>Circumcisio
Domini</i>, eight days after the Nativity, according
to St Luke ii. 21, (<i>postquam consummati sunt dies octo,
ut circumcideretur puer, vocatum est nomen ejus Jesus</i>). 2.
The Annunciation on the 25th March, which is also the
day of Christ’s conception, and so is placed nine months
before the 25th December. The historical evidence for
this day is on a par with that for Christmas. 3. The
Nativity of St John the Baptist, on the 24th June.
Another consequence was that the festival of the
<i>Occursus Domini</i> (ὑπαπάτη), <i>i.e.</i> the meeting of our
Lord with Simeon in the Temple, on Candlemas Day,
which was observed in Jerusalem before the introduction
of Christmas, had to be transferred to another day.
According to the regulations of the Jewish Law in Lev.
xii. 6, the period of uncleanness after birth lasted forty
days. And according to St Luke ii. 22, Mary submitted
to the Law in this respect. So long as our Lord’s birth
was commemorated at Epiphany on the 6th January,
the 15th February was the fortieth day after the
Nativity, and so, as a matter of fact, the festival of the
<i>Occursus Domini</i> was celebrated in Jerusalem on this
day in 385.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> But when the Nativity came to be celebrated
on the 25th December, the other festival had to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
be placed thirteen days earlier, on the 2nd February,
as it is at the present time.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<h5>2. <i>Advent and the Sundays until Septuagesima</i></h5>

<p>Christmas, like Easter, besides its Vigil and Octave,
has also a considerable period of preparation. This,
naturally, could only come into existence after the institution
of the festival, and indeed a certain time had to
elapse before it was organised. Since Christmas itself
was first observed in the middle of the fourth century,
it is not remarkable that the earliest clear reference to
Advent, from an official source, dates from the end of
the sixth century.</p>

<p>Some sort of preparatory season to Christmas, however,
existed before this. As in the case of Easter, this
preparatory season was marked by a fast commencing
on St Martin’s Day (11th November), and lasting until
Christmas. All Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
were fasted as in Lent. Such was the preparation
observed in Gaul since the appointment of the festival
by Bishop Perpetuus of Tours († 491). The same
observance existed in other parts of Gaul, for the first
Council of Maçon (581) prescribes exactly the same
order, and also that from St Martin’s Day to Christmas
the Mass shall be the same as during Lent—the first sign
of the liturgy for Advent. In the province of Tours there
was a similar enactment, although affecting the monks
alone, ordering them to fast through the whole of
December.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The Roman Church did not observe the
fast, although she treated Advent as a liturgical portion
of the Church’s year and incorporated it therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>Although the Greek Church has not marked the preparation
for Christmas in her liturgy, still she has
observed the fast since the eighth century. This begins
on St Philip’s day (the 14th November), and continues
for six weeks until Christmas. According to the
Mozarabic and Milanese rites, this is the length of
Advent. The Copts observe an Advent fast beginning
on the 19th Athyr (15th November).<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>Once the observance of Advent had been established
in Rome, it spread throughout the entire West. In
Spain we find it extended over five Sundays according
to the Lectionary of Silos, dating from about 650. It
took longer to make its way in France, although the way
had already been prepared for it by Perpetuus of Tours.
The service-books of the seventh century, the Lectionary
of Luxeuil, and the so-called <i>Missale Gothico-Gallicanum</i>,
edited by Mabillon, commence with the <i>Vigilia Natalis
Domini</i>, without Advent. In Rome, the institution of
Advent cannot be traced further back than to the sixth
century, for the sermons of St Augustine and Leo I.
make no mention of it. Unmistakable evidence for its
observance is found for the first time in the homilies of
Gregory the Great.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>The want of uniformity in the duration of Advent in
different parts of the Church is due to the fact that local
Churches, conformably to the ancient discipline, acted
independently of each other. Thus, in Rome Advent
lasted only four weeks, as we gather from the Gregorian
sacramentary, which provides three Sundays in December
with collects <i>de adventu Domini</i>, and a <i>dominica vacans</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
in the Appendix, however, five Sundays are reckoned
before Christmas.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The first traces of Advent are to be
sought for in the lectionaries, as, for instance, in that
drawn up by Bishop Victor of Capua (546-547), and
used by St Boniface.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> This contains four Epistles for
the Sundays before Christmas (de Adventu). The
Gelasian sacramentary has five Sundays in Advent,
but it has obviously been revised for the use of the
Frankish Churches. All service-books containing only
four Sundays in Advent belong to the Roman
rite.</p>

<p>In course of time the divergence between the Roman
and Frankish uses became noticeable and gave rise to
confusion. Amalarius remarks: In all missals and
lectionaries there are five Sundays in Advent, but in the
Antiphoner there are only three offices and a <i>Dominica
vacans</i>, and the Gregorian missal has only four Sundays
in Advent. In support of five Sundays, it was urged
that from the beginning of the world until the Christian
era five of the seven ages of the world had passed.
Even in the tenth century, opinions were expressed in
favour of five weeks. It was urged that, according to
the other practice, if Christmas fell on a Monday,
Advent strictly speaking lasted only three weeks. Abbo
of Fleury († 1004) is witness to the existence of a twofold
practice in a later period.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> In the eighth century,
an Advent of four weeks was observed in France wherever
Roman influence extended. Berno of Reichenau
in his writings on Advent is only occupied with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
question how to deal with the vigil of Christmas when
the 25th December falls on a Monday. The Micrologus
does not mention an Advent season of five weeks, nor
does Beleth.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> A deviation from this custom appears in
the Milanese and Mozarabic rites which prescribe a
duration of six weeks for Advent, thus bringing it into
conformity in this respect with Lent.</p>

<p>At first Advent was regarded merely as a time for
penance and mortification in the same way as Lent. On
this account, it was widely observed as a time of fasting,
although the Church had nowhere so ordered it. Later
on, again, Advent was regarded as a type or memorial
of the Old Testament or the time before Christ. However,
the view that the four weeks of Advent typify
the four thousand years from Adam to Christ, impressive
as it is, finds no support from the Liturgy. On the
contrary, the lections from Genesis in the Breviary
begin in Septuagesima, while during Advent the lections
are taken from the Prophet Isaias.</p>

<p>As far as the lections from Scripture are concerned,
the Gospel for the second Sunday in Advent recounts our
Lord’s Messianic labours, while His birth is only commemorated
some two or three weeks later. The Gospel
for the first Sunday speaks of the end of the world, not,
as one would expect, of its creation. The mediæval
lectionaries, moreover, replace St Luke xxi. 25 <i>et seqq.</i>
on this Sunday with the Gospel <i>Cum appropinquasset
Jerusalem</i>, etc. (St Matthew xxi. 1 <i>et seqq.</i>),<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and the preceding
Sunday is sometimes called <i>Dominica in præparatione
Adventus</i>, or <i>Dominica Quinta ante Natalem
Domini</i>, in which we see a remnant of the more ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
reckoning. The collects of the Mass express the hope
of the Messias and the longing for His appearance.</p>

<p>We must also consider Christmas in connection with
the festivals which follow in the course of the year, such
as the Circumcision of our Lord, which, of course, falls
on the eighth day after Christmas, the <i>Octava Domini</i>,
the Epiphany, and Candlemas Day. Thus quite naturally,
as it were, a cycle of festivals has grown up round
Christmas Day.</p>

<p>We may also mention the Sunday in the Octave of
Christmas with its Gospel giving the account of the
meeting of Jesus and His parents with Simeon and Anna.
The Gospel for the Sunday after New Year’s Day records
the flight into Egypt. The Sundays after Epiphany
form connecting links between Christmas and Easter,
varying from two to six, according as Easter falls earlier
or later. Only the two first Sundays have any distinctive
character, the first commemorating the visit of
our Lord to the Temple at the age of twelve years, and
the second His first miracle at Cana of Galilee.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The
remaining Sundays, along with Septuagesima and
Sexagesima, do not commemorate any historical event
in their lections from Scripture; Quinquagesima and the
Sundays in Lent direct our attention to the approaching
Passion. In the case of the Sundays three to six after
Epiphany, this is intentional, since they are liable to be
transferred from their proper place to the end of the year
when necessary.</p>

<p>The Sunday in the Octave of Christmas, or, as it was
formerly called, the Sunday after Christmas, has as its
Gospel St Luke ii. 33-40, which gives the account of
Simeon’s prophecy. Chronologically speaking, this passage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
comes before its time, for, in St Luke’s Gospel, it
comes after the passage chosen as the Gospel for Candlemas
(St Luke ii. 22-32), of which it forms the continuation.
In the last verse (ii. 39), mention is made of the
return from Jerusalem or Bethlehem to Nazareth.
The events, however, which follow in the course of the
Church’s year—the circumcision and the arrival of the
Wise Men—must have happened before the return to
Galilee.</p>

<h5>3. <i>The Octave of Christmas. The Circumcision. The
New Year</i></h5>

<p>Since Easter, after the example given by the Synagogue,
was from the first observed with an octave, and,
since Epiphany had its octave already in the eighth
century, it was inevitable that Christmas should be provided
with one also. Accordingly, the eighth day after
Christmas bears the name <i>Octava Domini</i> (In Octavas
Domini) in the Gelasian<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> and Gregorian sacramentaries,
whence it may be inferred that it was not yet regarded
as an independent festival and passed unnoticed if it
fell on a week-day.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it was partially observed as a
popular holiday, at least it gave occasion in many
places for popular rejoicings,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> being the day on which
the Roman Calendar began a new year. In Ravenna it
was marked by dancing and masquerades, against which
Peter Chrysologus inveighed in his 155th Sermon. Since
he forbids Christians to put in even an appearance at
these entertainments, they must have been of an
objectionable nature. It was the same in Gaul even in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
the sixth century and later. The second Council of
Tours, and the Councils of Auxerre and Rouen (650) were
compelled to forbid these rejoicings. With a view to
counteracting their influence, the bishops exhorted the
faithful to attend divine service on this day, and appointed
somewhat earlier penitential processions
(<i>litaniæ</i>) to be privately performed in atonement for the
sins committed at this season.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> In Spain, the eleventh
canon of the fourth Council of Toledo commanded a
strict fast and abstinence for the same object, and the
Allelujah was omitted from the psalmody. In 650, a
law of the Kings Recceswinth and Erwig made the
Kalends of January a festival of obligation.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> In Rome,
in the eighth century, the people spent the nights
dancing in the streets to the scandal of pilgrims from the
north, as Boniface informed Pope Zacharias. These
abuses lingered longest in France though divested of their
heathen character. Late on in the Middle Ages, we find
a remnant of them in the so-called Feast of Fools, at
which ecclesiastical customs were travestied by the
election of a Bishop of Fools and by all sorts of misconduct
in the churches. Things became so bad that
the papal legate, Cardinal Peter, felt compelled to order
Odo, Bishop of Paris, to pronounce excommunication on
all who took part in such proceedings. The bishop
prohibited the abuse in the strongest manner in 1199, but
in spite of repeated ecclesiastical censures, it continued
on into the fifteenth century, as appears from a report of
the theological faculty of Paris in 1444.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>The 1st January appears as an ecclesiastical festival at
Rome for the first time at the beginning of the ninth
century, where it is called from the first <i>Circumcisio
Domini</i>, the name which it bears among the Greeks,
Syrians, and Copts.</p>

<p>We have already observed that in the Gregorian
sacramentary the 1st January is simply called <i>Octava
Domini</i>. The same is also the case in the Calendar of
St Geneviève, edited by Fronteau, which was written
between 714 and 731.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> In the <i>Homiliarium</i> of Charlemagne
compiled by Paul the Deacon between 786 and
797, the day is still called <i>in octavas Domini</i>, i.e. <i>Calendas
Januarias</i>.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The change of name must have been
effected shortly after this. Although among the sermons
of Zeno of Verona,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> there is one on the circumcision of
our Lord, this only proves that he treated of this subject
in his discourse, and affords no evidence for the existence
of the festival. In the Calendar of Charlemagne,
edited by Piper, dating from between 731 and 781, the
name <i>Circumcisio</i> occurs, so too in the list of Festivals
of Sonnatius. On the other hand, the Gregorian
sacramentary written, under Archbishop Otgar, about
840 for the monastery of St Alban near Mainz, has only
<i>Octava Domini</i>.</p>

<p>The idea and date of this festival are derived from
St Luke ii. 21, since eight days after birth our Lord was
circumcised and received His human name, which,
according to Jewish usage, was given at the same time.
Later on, a special feast in honour of the Holy Name
was instituted and appointed for the second Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
after Epiphany. Its celebration was permitted to the
Franciscans by Clement VII. in 1530, but the cultus of
the Holy Name is due in a great measure to the influence
of St Bernardine of Siena. On 20th December 1721,
Innocent XIII. appointed this feast to be observed by
the whole Church.</p>

<p>The Liturgy makes no reference to the commencement
of the civil year, although in the lectionary of Silos
this day is called <i>Caput Anni</i>.</p>

<h5>4. <i>The Epiphany</i></h5>

<p>As the name Epiphany implies, the origin and early
celebration of this festival is to be sought in the East.
Among the Syrians, it is called <i>denho</i>, or “Going forth,”
in the sense of “<i>oriens ex alto</i>” (St Luke i. 78). Among
the Greeks, it goes by the name of τά ἐπιφάνια or
ἡ ἐπιφάνιος sc. ἡμέρα, and θεοφάνεια. For the most
part, the Latins employed the Greek name, or an
equivalent, such as <i>Festivitas Declarationis</i>, used by Leo
the Great, <i>manifestatio</i>, by Fulgentius, or <i>apparitio</i> by
others.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> The root, from which the Greek ἐπιφαίνω is
derived, was employed to describe the dawn, and the
adjective ἐπιφανής was applied to the appearances of the
gods bringing help to men.</p>

<p>These names sufficiently disclose the idea commemorated
by the feast—the commemoration of the
appearance of the Son of God on earth in general, with
special reference to those occasions in His life on which
His divine sonship was revealed in some distinctive
manner. Prominent among those occasions were His
Nativity, the worship of the three wise men from the
East, the baptism in Jordan with its accompanying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
theophany, and the miracles through which He manifested
His divine power, especially the first miracle at
the marriage in Cana. Accordingly people spoke of
divine manifestations, in the plural, for the name <i>dies
epiphaniarum sive manifestationum</i> was known to the
heathen.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>The feast was kept on the 6th January. The first
indication that this day was marked in some special
way in the Christian Calendar is given by Clement of
Alexandria, who says that some of the orthodox in his
day regarded it as the birth-day of Christ, while the
Basilidians observed the 10th January.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> This of course
does not prove that the 6th January was observed at
that time in Alexandria as a festival. Origen omits it
from the list of festivals he gives in <i>C. Cels.</i>, 8, 22. It
appears, however, among the writings of Hippolytus, in
an earnest exhortation which he addressed to a candidate
for baptism shortly before the day of the “Divine
Manifestations” (εἰς τὰ ἅγια ἐπιφάνεια), when baptism
was to be received. He starts with the baptism of
Jesus, and then treats of the effects of baptism, and of
worthy preparation for its reception.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> A much later
writer, who is however not to be quite disregarded,
Bishop John of Nicæa in the ninth century, traces back
the institution of the festival to disciples of St John.</p>

<p>Epiphany commemorates several events in the life of
Jesus by which He manifested His divinity. One of these
is His baptism by St John in Jordan,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> for, according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
the scriptural narrative, at the time of His baptism a
voice from heaven was heard proclaiming Jesus to be
the Son of God, and the Holy Ghost visibly appeared
in bodily shape as a dove. The baptism in Jordan is
the special event commemorated by Epiphany among
the Easterns, <i>e.g.</i>, in the oldest Coptic Calendar Epiphany
is called <i>Dies Baptismi Sanctificati</i>, and in a
later one <i>Immersio Domini</i>.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The earliest existing
sermon on the day—the homily of Hippolytus—treats
exclusively of the baptism of Jesus. Chrysostom, in
addition to the baptism, speaks of our Lord’s second
coming in Judgment as an event commemorated by the
festival. On account of its connection with the baptism,
this festival has among the Greeks the secondary title
of “Feast of Lights,” (ἑορτὴ τῶν φώτων);<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and in
Ireland, contrary to the ancient custom of the Church,
solemn baptism was administered on this day.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The second event commemorated on the 6th January
is the visit of the three Wise Men who, by their gifts,
recognised Christ as God and Man and Redeemer, and
worshipped Him as the long expected King of the Jews.
The Wise Men found the divine Child still in Bethlehem,
though no longer in the stable, as artists usually represent
the scene, but in a roofed house<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> where His parents
were temporarily lodged. The evangelists give no
indication how long after the Nativity this took place.</p>

<p>The visit of the Magi appears as the sole event commemorated
by Epiphany in the six sermons of Augustine
delivered on the feast (Sermons 199-204). Fulgentius
in his four sermons on Epiphany treats only of this
event and of the slaughter of the innocents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>The Mass in the Gelasian sacramentary refers in the
collects and preface only to these mysteries, and not to the
two others, and the Gospel<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> relates the visit of the Magi.</p>

<p>The third event commemorated is the first miracle
performed at the marriage in Cana, by which our Lord
manifested His divine power. This threefold commemoration
is still recognised in the present Roman
liturgy, and finds expression in the antiphon to the
<i>Benedictus</i>, which runs: “On this day the Church is
joined to her celestial Bridegroom, because Christ
washed away her sins in Jordan, the Magi hasten with
gifts to the royal espousals and the guests are gladdened
with water changed into wine.”</p>

<p>Polemius Silvius notices the three events in his
Calendar on this day. Paulinus of Nola<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> expressly
mentions them. They are especially dwelt upon and
distinguished in a sermon of Sedatus, Bishop of Béziers,
in the sixth century.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Maximus of Turin was acquainted
with the threefold commemoration, but doubts if they
all actually happened on the same day, the 6th January.</p>

<p>Later on, in mediæval times, there was a tendency to
include under the Epiphany other manifestations of
Christ’s divine power, such as the miracle of the loaves,
and the resurrection of Lazarus.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>There is hardly any trace in the West of Epiphany as
the festival of our Lord’s birth,<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> and even in the East this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
significance of the feast was forgotten after the institution
of Christmas. Lingering traces of the earlier
conception which had not quite died out in the East, may
perhaps have been the occasion of a polemic from St
Jerome,<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> when he declared that the Epiphany had never
been regarded as a festival of Christ’s nativity.</p>

<p>By the introduction of Christmas, Epiphany naturally
lost its character as the day of Christ’s birth, even in
those parts of the Church where it had originally been
regarded as such. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at
that Chrysostom, as introducer of Christmas, felt compelled
to explain to his hearers more particularly the
difference between the feasts. Christ, he says, did not
appear at His birth openly and to all, but only to a few
persons, and so little was His divinity manifested
thereby that St John the Baptist was able to say:
“There hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you
know not.” From the moment of His baptism, His
divinity was evident to all, and consequently the festival
instituted in honour of the baptism of Jesus bears the
name of Epiphany. Moreover, there is yet another and
a fuller appearance of the Lord which will take place at
the end of the world. Hence the necessity, according
to St Chrysostom, of celebrating in addition to the
Epiphany a special festival in honour of Christ’s birth.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Epiphany first appears with an octave in the Calendars
of the eighth century. In the Gregorian sacramentary
it is without an octave, but has a vigil. In the Calendar
of Fronteau the festival is kept up for three days.</p>

<p>One of the special observances connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
feast was the publication on the 6th January of the
annual pastoral letter of the Patriarchs of Alexandria—the
<i>epistola festalis</i>—announcing the date of Easter for
the current year. In 541, the fourth Council of Orleans
(can. 1) ordered the same thing for the West, also the
Councils of Auxerre in 578 and 585 (can. 2). In the Middle
Ages the dates of the other movable feasts were added
to the date of Easter (Pontif. Rom.), as is still done in
some places, as for example, Turin, at the present day.</p>

<p>The festival was kept with special solemnity at
Jerusalem, as we learn from the description of it given by
the Gallic Pilgrim. Unfortunately, the beginning with
the special account of the feast is missing, but there is
no doubt that the foregoing paragraph described the
Epiphany, for the succeeding festival is spoken of as
<i>quadragesima de Epiphania</i> (c. 26).</p>

<p>According to this document a procession from Jerusalem
to Bethlehem took place on the eve, returning in
the early morning. After a time for rest, the service
commenced about the second hour of the day in the great
church on Golgotha, which was richly decorated. At
the conclusion of the function the faithful proceeded to
the church of the Anastasis, and, about the sixth hour,
or twelve o’clock, the festival was at an end. In the
evening vespers (<i>lucernare</i>) were sung. On the second
and third days service was held in the same church, on
the fourth day in the church called Eleona on the Mount
of Olives, on the fifth day in the <i>Lazarium</i>, the grave of
Lazarus in Bethania, on the sixth day in Sion, on the
seventh day in the church of the Anastasis, on the
eighth day in the church of the Holy Cross. Thus
both in Jerusalem and in Bethlehem the feast lasted
eight days—a kind of octave.</p>

<p>In the Eastern Churches the day is further distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
by the solemn blessing of the water, mentioned
by Chrysostom and intended to recall the miracle at
Cana. This is a very popular festival, but in many places
has been stripped of its religious character; it is performed
by the clergy going in procession to the sea or to
a river, reciting a prayer, and then throwing a crucifix
into the water which is fetched out again by swimmers
and takes place on the 18th January (old style).</p>

<p>With regard to the antiquity and spread of the feast,
it was unknown in North Africa during the third century,
for Tertullian makes no reference to it, and even in the
time of St Augustine it was rejected by the Donatists as
an Oriental novelty.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> In Origen’s time, at least, it was
not generally observed as a festival in Alexandria, since
he does not reckon it as such. For Rome, evidence is
wanting for the earliest times, but since the daughter
Church of North Africa knew nothing of the festival at
first, it may be inferred that originally it was not kept
at Rome but was introduced there in the course of time.
In Spain, it was a feast-day in 380, in Gaul, in 361, and
there is evidence of its existence in Thrace as early as
304.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> In the East it generally held the place of Christmas
as our Lord’s birth-day,<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> and as such it had already,
as early as the first half of the third century, become
domiciled in the Church, as is shown by the recently
published <i>Testamentum Jesu Christi</i>, where it is twice
named as a high festival along with Easter and Pentecost.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
In the Roman Empire, as early as <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 400,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Epiphany was one of the days on which games in the
circus were forbidden by law. Not until Justinian’s<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
time were the law courts closed<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> on this day also.</p>

<h5>5. <i>The Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary</i><br>
(CANDLEMAS)</h5>

<p>By the mosaic law, every mother, after giving birth
to a son, remained unclean for seven days, in the first
instance, and then, for thirty-three days longer, was
excluded from participation in public worship. After
the birth of a daughter the period of ceremonial uncleanness
was twice as long. Thus the whole period lasted
for forty or eighty days, and at its conclusion the woman
had to bring a yearling lamb for a holocaust and a
pigeon for a sin-offering. In case of poverty, two young
pigeons or turtle-doves sufficed as an offering (Lev. xii.
2-8). According to the narrative in the Gospels, Mary,
after the birth of Jesus, fulfilled the commands of this
law and brought the prescribed offering to the Temple
on the fortieth day, on which occasion the meeting with
Simeon and Anna took place (St Luke ii. 22 <i>et seqq.</i>).</p>

<p>Our Blessed Lady and her divine Son, in the first
place, and, secondarily, Simeon and Anna are the actors
in this scene, and it would have been strange had this
event not been commemorated very early among the
Church’s festivals.</p>

<p>The first reference to such a commemoration belongs
to the last decades of the fourth century and comes from
Jerusalem. It is contained in the diary of the so-called
Silvia. The day was ushered in by a solemn procession,
followed by a sermon on St Luke ii. 22 <i>seqq.</i>, and a Mass.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
It had as yet no special name, but was known merely as
the fortieth day after the Epiphany. This goes to
prove that at that time the Epiphany was regarded in
Jerusalem as the day of the Lord’s birth, and it follows
indirectly from the expressions used (<i>hic</i>) that the
festival was not yet known in the Pilgrim’s home.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>It seems probable that the festival was first of all
observed in Jerusalem from whence it spread through
out the whole Church. The person by whom, and the
time when it was first introduced into Constantinople
and the Byzantine empire, are known to us. A plague
having caused frightful mortality, the Emperor
Justinian, as soon as it had passed away, ordered the
Purification to be observed for the first time in 542.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
The contradictory evidence in Georgius Hamartolus
and Nicephorus<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> that it was the Emperor Justin,
Justinian’s predecessor, who introduced the festival
and ordered it to be observed throughout the world,
seems due simply to a confusion between the two
emperors. In any case the spread of the feast throughout
a wider area dates from this time.</p>

<p>The name by which the festival was known, now that
it was widely adopted in different districts, was “The
Meeting,” in Greek <i>Hypapante</i>, in Latin <i>Occursus
Domini</i>, in reference to the meeting between the Child
Jesus and Simeon and Anna; it may be that this
festival was introduced at Rome in consequence of
Justinian’s commands, but no evidence to that effect
is extant. As far as Rome is concerned, it appears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
in the Gelasian sacramentary with the new name of
<i>Purificatio</i>, and as a feast of our Blessed Lady, without
any mention of a procession.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Pope Sergius I.
(687-701) ordained, however, a procession on this as on
the other principal festivals of Our Lady. In the
passage in question of the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>, the festival
has the remarkable name of St Simeon’s Day, “which the
Greeks call Hypapante,” which seems to show that the
festival had not yet been well established in Rome.
Moreover, the 2nd February was observed among the
Greeks as the actual day of Simeon’s death, because in
his canticle he had said, “<i>Now</i> Thou dost dismiss Thy
servant ... in peace.”<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> That the festival was only
introduced at a late date in many places in the West is
proved by the fact that in the Lectionary of Silos, the
oldest belonging to the Spanish Church, and dating about
650, it does not appear. The same is the case with
regard to the Calendar of St Geneviève in Paris (731-741)
published by Fronteau.</p>

<p>Formerly the general opinion was that it had been
introduced in Rome by Pope Gelasius I. in order that he
might replace the heathen <i>Lupercalia</i>, with their midnight
torch processions and disorderly proceedings, by a
popular Christian festivity. This opinion<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> cannot be
maintained in the face of the facts referred to above.
The <i>Lupercalia</i> indeed fell on the 15th February, which
also happened to be the day on which this festival was
originally kept in Jerusalem, but the Gallic pilgrim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
makes no mention of lights carried in the procession.
Again, processions, with or without lights, were so
common both among the Christians and heathen of the
early Christian era, that any connection between the
procession on Candlemas Day and the <i>Lupercalia</i> cannot
be inferred.</p>

<p>The <i>Invitatorium</i> (<i>Gaude et lætare, Jerusalem, occurrens
Deo tuo</i>), and the preface, which is that for Christmas,
show that originally the feast was rather a festival
of Our Lord than of Our Lady. The collect for the day
speaks of the presentation of the Lord in the Temple
alone, and the antiphons for the most part refer to the
same event, while the psalms are those of Our Lady’s
feasts. The Gospel for the day (St Luke ii. 22-23), the
same now as in the fourth century, chronologically
speaking, precedes the Gospel for the previous Sunday.
For the Sunday after Christmas has St Luke ii. 33-40
for its Gospel, which relates the return of the Holy
Family from Judæa to Galilee.</p>

<h5>6. <i>The Sundays of the Church’s Year as forming connecting-links
between the principal Feasts</i></h5>

<p>During the age of the persecutions it was scarcely
possible for Christians to observe any other festival than
Sunday, and so it is not surprising that the two writers,
who have occasion to speak of the institution of the
festivals of the Church, mention only Easter and Pentecost,
both of which fall on Sundays. To these Christmas
was added in the fourth century, and Epiphany somewhat
earlier. These chief festivals, along with others
soon added to their number, formed the elements for
the organisation of a festal system in the Church,
as centres round which the lesser festivals grouped
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>The last step of importance, however, in this development
of the Church’s year was to connect these chief
festivals with one another, so as to make them parts of a
whole. The Sundays afforded a convenient means for
effecting this. They were associated with the festal
character of the nearest feast and were connected with
it as links in a chain. The way for this development
had been prepared by the season of preparation before
Easter, and by the relation in which Easter stood to
Pentecost. The Sundays of Lent had their own character
as a preparation for Easter, and the Sundays in
the fifty days between Easter and Pentecost—Quinquagesima—were
marked by the festal character with
which antiquity invested the whole period. All that
was needed was, first of all, to connect Christmas, Easter,
and Pentecost, and, in the second place, the institution
of a season of preparation before Christmas. This was
accomplished between the sixth and the eighth centuries.</p>

<p>During the first six centuries, the ordinary Sundays
of the year had neither liturgical position or character,
since they were not even enumerated. There was a
sort of <i>commune dominicarum</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a number of masses
existed from which one could be chosen at will for each
Sunday. To these Sundays, which were called simply
<i>dominicæ quotidianæ</i>, those after Epiphany and Pentecost
belonged.</p>

<p>They numbered altogether twenty-nine or thirty,
according as the Calendar gave fifty-two or fifty-three
Sundays in the year. For the sum of the days of the year,
365, divided by seven makes fifty-two and one over, and
so the year which commences on a Sunday has fifty-three
Sundays, the others only fifty-two. The smaller
number of these, six at most, come between Epiphany
and Septuagesima, but the larger, twenty-three to twenty-eight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
between Whitsunday and Advent. The variation
depends upon the date of Easter. There is no historical
circumstance forthcoming to give these Sundays a
specially festal character. With Pentecost the commemoration
of Our Lord’s redemptive acts concludes,
and it was not the custom in the West to include events
from Church history in the cycle of feasts, although the
East celebrated a few, as, for example, the General
Councils.</p>

<p>With regard to the Roman rite in particular, there are
no special masses for the Sundays after Easter and
Pentecost in the Leonine sacramentary. A further
development appears in the Gelasian sacramentary,
where the Sundays in Lent and those between Easter
and Pentecost alone have a clearly defined liturgical
character, and keep their special place in the Calendar.
For the remaining Sundays of the year, there was a
choice of only sixteen masses, which are not in the
first book of the Gelasian sacramentary containing
the course for the year (<i>anni circulus</i>, i.e., <i>Proprium
de tempore</i>), but at the commencement of the third
book. Along with the masses for week-days and masses
for special occasions, they form the contents of this
volume. The masses for Advent, however, strange to
say, are contained in the second book, thus out of
chronological order.</p>

<p>In the Gregorian sacramentary, at the end of the
eighth century, the Church’s year has the same form as
at the present day, with the sole exception that the
Sundays in Advent come at the end, instead of, as at the
present time, at the beginning of the Missal. This is
due to the fact that Christmas was then usually regarded
as the commencement of the year.</p>

<p>In the construction of the ecclesiastical year, the Gallic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
and Spanish Churches followed the Roman. The
Mozarabic breviary has five Sundays in Advent, but
they stand at the beginning. They are in the same
position in the <i>Liber Responsalis sive Antiphonarius</i>,
contained in a Codex of Compiègne belonging to the
ninth century, and falsely attributed to Gregory the
Great.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>The Gregorian sacramentary simply numbers the
Sundays consecutively after Pentecost, but in the
Frankish lectionaries there are signs of an attempt to
separate the Sundays after Pentecost into groups—Sundays
after SS. Peter and Paul, Sundays after
St Lawrence, etc.—but the custom was afterwards
abandoned.</p>

<p>In France, this division of the Sundays after Pentecost
seems to have been general in the eighth century. The
<i>Homilarium</i> of Charlemagne divides them as follows:—</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="6" class="valign">22</td>
    <td>{</td>
    <td>Four Sundays after Epiphany.</td>

    <td>Six Sundays after St Michael, 29th Sept. (Post S. Angeli).</td>
  </tr>

<p>The <i>Kalendarium Frontonis</i> divides them thus:—</p>

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="4" class="valign">19</td>
    <td>{</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>This gives only nineteen after Pentecost, and so the
<i>Kalendarium Frontonis</i> has ten Sundays after Epiphany
until Septuagesima, which must clearly have helped to
fill up, when necessary, what was wanting at the end of
the year.</p>

<p>The <i>Comes Albini</i> in Ranke (App. iv.) gives:—</p>

<p>The Gregorian sacramentary, written for Mainz under
Archbishop Otgar about 840, has six Sundays after
Epiphany, four <i>post Pentecosten</i>, then six <i>post natale
Apostolorum</i>, six more <i>post natale S. Laurentii</i> and
eight <i>post S. Archangeli</i>—in all, twenty-four.</p>

<p>The Lectionary of Luxeuil of the seventh century stands
alone in giving merely two Sundays <i>post Theophaniam</i>,
and three <i>post Cathedram S. Petri</i>. The Sundays in Lent
as well as Septuagesima are not marked in any special
way. The first of these peculiarities is less remarkable
since, even in the Gelasian sacramentary, the Sundays
after Epiphany are not given a distinctive name. All
these attempts to split up the Sundays into small groups
were subsequently abandoned, and the simple manner
of enumeration found in the Roman rite was adopted.
A careful observer will have noticed that the year is
divided into two very unequal parts. The movable
feasts all fall in the first half, leaving the second half
devoid of festivals. Even the week-days in Lent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
and in the octaves of Easter and Pentecost, are each
provided with special lections and masses. Without
doubt this is due to the fact that in the earliest times
the entire season before Easter was occupied with the
instruction of Catechumens. The necessity of providing
them with as much instruction as possible led to this
increased liturgical activity. It appears almost as if
the abandonment of the Catechumenate resulted in a
decrease of this activity, and brought matters to a standstill.
A long period elapsed before any fresh efforts
were made in the direction of completing the course of
the ecclesiastical year.</p>

<p>The Greeks have stopped short with their ecclesiastical
year only half made. They have a fairly complete cycle
of Easter festivals, and they have adopted Christmas,
but without its proper setting since they have no
Advent. But their manner of enumerating the Sundays
after Pentecost is very different from that adopted in the
West. That is to say, they name the Sundays after the
passages of Scripture read in the Gospel for the day.</p>

<p>From Easter to Whitsunday, the Gospels for Sundays
and other days are taken from St John; from the Sunday
after Pentecost to the exaltation of the Holy Cross (14th
September), from St Matthew; and for the following
fifteen weeks from St Luke. The former Sundays are
called Sundays after St Matthew, the latter, Sundays
after St Luke. The latter extend over the New Year
and Epiphany—for no notice is taken of Advent in the
lections. St Mark’s Gospel supplies lections for most
of the Saturdays and Sundays of Lent, as well as for a
number of week-days throughout the course of the year.
But the Sundays in question are not called Sundays
after St Mark, any more than the Sundays between
Easter and Pentecost are called Sundays after St John;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
but they take their names partly from their position as
Sundays in Lent and partly from the incidents related
in the Gospel for the day. In the Eastern system the
connection between the Sundays and the festivals is
purely external and not organic.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>In speaking of the ecclesiastical year of the Greeks
and Orientals, it must be borne in mind that they do not
possess the same quantity of formularies for the Mass as
we do, but, throughout the course of the year, they
employ only two or three. The result is monotony, and
it is practically only the Gospel for the day in which
the festal character of the celebration finds expression.
Among the Latins, on the other hand, the introit, collect,
etc., all emphasise the character of the feast, and still
more clearly the lections from Scripture. On this
account, a few remarks as to their origin and that of
the lections in the Breviary may not be out of place.</p>

<p>Evidence for the earliest period is lacking, but there
is no doubt the choice of what was to be read rested with
the bishop and that he also fixed the length of the
lections. In certain cases, and for many days, the choice
presented no difficulty, the lections being determined by
the character of the feast itself. We can, for example,
determine the lections for a number of days used in the
fourth century in Jerusalem. Several of them agree
with those now in use.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Very early, a series of lections
for the canonical hours must have been drawn up for
use in monasteries, and then this in its turn influenced
the lections in the liturgy. In the Middle Ages, it was
thought that St Jerome was the originator of such a
series of lections, and accordingly the lectionary was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
called by his name. It is certain that a lectionary
existed as early as the fifth century, for which the so-called
<i>Carta Cornutiana</i> affords proof.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>When we examine more closely the order of lections,
we notice they do not harmonise with the ideas presented
by the different parts of the ecclesiastical year, as now
existing, but they do agree with the form which it took
in the earliest stages of its development. The consequence
is that the lections are appropriately chosen for
the pascal season and for Whitsuntide, but do not fit
in with the festal character of Advent and the Christmas
cycle. As we have said, the ecclesiastical year began
originally with the preparation for Easter, <i>i.e.</i> Lent.
The lections from the five books of Moses which start
with Septuagesima were then in their proper place,
treating as they do of the fall and the divine scheme for
man’s restoration.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">C. Other Incidents in the Church’s Year</span></h4>

<h5>1. <i>The Embertides</i></h5>

<p>The Embertides<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> are peculiar to the Western or
Roman Church. In Rome they have been observed
from the earliest times, and so Leo the Great was inclined
to ascribe to them an apostolic origin. This Pope
connects them with the four seasons of the year,<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
gives them a special signification in as much as we then
give God due honour and praise for the gifts He gives us
to support our bodily life. Again, they move us to
make a good use of the gifts thus bestowed, to abstain
from superfluities, and to impart our gifts generously to
those in need. We must neither murmur over the
fewness of some gifts, nor be discontented with the
excess of others, as may even sometimes happen. God’s
will should be our will.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The Embertides in general,
but especially that of December, he directly connects
with agriculture and the harvest (<i>ut omnium fructum
collectione conclusa</i>, etc., <i>Sermo 16</i>, c. 2); and the
earliest liturgies<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> contain prayers for the same purpose;
such indications as these give us the clue to the origin
of these fasts. By them practices originally heathen have
assumed a Christian form and character. The Romans,
originally, were compelled to be an agricultural
people, and their gods were for the most part deities
who presided over agriculture, as Tertullian early
remarked (Sterculus, Epona, Mutunus, etc.), and their
worship was closely connected with the stages of cultivation.
The chief incidents were accompanied by
religious ceremonies and usages. A blessing was asked
on the sowing of the seed at the <i>feriæ sementivæ</i>,
observed between the end of November and the
Winter solstice, <i>i.e.</i> in December. At the time of
harvest, the <i>feriæ messis</i> were celebrated, and at the
vintage, the <i>feriæ vindemiales</i>.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>With the fact that the heathen worship of Rome
recognised three sorts of such <i>feriæ</i> observed thrice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
in the year (no evidence of a fourth being forthcoming),
agrees a passage in the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>, which
has long been regarded as the earliest evidence for the
observance of Embertides, though it fell short of absolute
proof. The passage states that Calixtus (217-222)
ordained a fast on three Saturdays in the year.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> The
number corresponds well with the three sets of heathen
<i>feriæ</i> mentioned above. As St Leo speaks of four fasts
of this kind yearly in the fifth century, the fourth fast,
corresponding to the fourfold division of the year, must
have been added in the course of the fourth century. It
may be that the passage, Zacharias viii. 19, referring
to a Jewish custom of sanctifying by a fast the four
seasons of the year, helped to bring this about.</p>

<p>All four Embertides are mentioned in the sermon of
Leo the Great, and both the Leonine and Gelasian
sacramentaries agree in marking Wednesday, Friday,
and Saturday as the days to be observed as fasts.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Pope
Gelasius<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> appointed that ordinations of priests and
deacons were to be held on all Embertides, and in the
middle of Lent, whereas in St Leo’s time the ordination
of priests took place at Easter only.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>The Ember fasts were called <i>jejunium primi, quarti,
septimi et decimi mensis</i>, in the earliest service-books,
and fell in March, June, September, and December.
The week in each of the aforesaid months, in which the
Ember fast was to be observed, appears not to have
been definitely fixed in earlier days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>If the opinion of Morin is correct, this would agree
with the fact that the harvest feast was not fixed for
any day in particular, but was determined by the
pontiffs in each case. However, it remained for a long
period undetermined whether the first Embertide should
be observed before or during the course of Lent, and also
in which week of Advent the last Embertide should fall.
The present arrangement, according to the Micrologus<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
was first made by Gregory VII., <i>i.e.</i>, the first Embertide
to fall in the first week of Lent, the second in Whitsun
week, the third in the third week of September, the
fourth in the third week in Advent.</p>

<p>According to what has been said the Ember fasts were
distinctively Roman in origin, and indeed belonged to
the city of Rome, and the Roman bishops by repeated
injunctions ordered their colleagues in Italy to adopt
them in the first instance. In Gaul and in the Christian
districts of Germany, their adoption was due to the
patronage given to Roman usages by the Carolingians:
in Spain the Ember Days were unknown until the Roman
ritual was introduced in the eleventh century, and in
Milan they were introduced much later, in fact by St
Charles Borromeo.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> It does not appear from history
that the original object of the Ember Days was to
petition God to raise up worthy priests in His Church.
They are first mentioned in this connection after the
popes had appointed them as the fixed times for ordinations.
They owe their origin to the agricultural festivals
of ancient Rome, as appears plainly from the references
of Leo the Great,<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> to the December fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>In a later age, they lost entirely their early significance
and came to be regarded solely as days of penitence and
prayer. In the prayers of the actual Roman missal,
no trace of their original character is to be found. The
Ember masses of Advent refer to the coming of Christ,
those of Lent to the suffering caused by sin, and its
Atonement, those of Whitsun week to the descent of the
Holy Ghost. Where the prayers do not relate to these
subjects they contain no special references, or deal only
with fasting in general and its necessity. The masses
for the September Ember Days alone preserve some
traces of their historical origin, in as much as they are
principally of a festive character (<i>Exultate</i>, etc.), such as
might refer to a harvest safely gathered in. But such a
connection cannot be proved beyond doubt.</p>

<p>When we go through the prayers in the oldest sacramentaries
we find the same thing. The name of Embertide
is not indeed employed, and the days are not yet
marked as fast-days, but the Saturdays are distinguished,
twice in the Gelasian, and on all four Embertides in
the Gregorian sacramentary, by having twelve lessons.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
With regard to the later recensions of these two sacramentaries,
the Gelasian contains two formulæ for announcing
the Ember fasts to the faithful after the “<i>Pax
Domini sit semper vobiscum</i>”<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> in the Mass. In the first
part, there is a Mass for the three Ember Days of the
fourth month, June, and, in the second part, for September
and December as well,<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> while the March Ember
Days are merely indicated in Nos. XIX. and XX. of the
first part. In the Frankish Gregorian sacramentary
it is the same; masses are given for March, June, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
September but not for December.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Few of the prayers
in these two sacramentaries are contained in the missal
actually in use. It is to be remarked concerning the
lections that they numbered twelve on the Saturdays.
The present Roman missal prescribes three lections for
the Wednesdays, but for the Fridays only two as usual.
For the Saturdays, however, the number reaches six,
and, in the Advent Embertide, seven, including the
Gospel.</p>

<p>That there were only three Embertides (<i>i.e.</i> the
<i>jejunium quarti, septimi, et decimi mensis</i>) given in the
ancient service-books is not surprising, since the fast in
March fell usually in Lent and so needed no special
mention.</p>

<p>With regard to the spread of Ember Days in the West,
they made their way slowly and seemed to have been
earliest adopted by the Anglo-Saxons, who at their conversion
accepted the Roman ritual as a whole. They are
ordered to be observed by the Council of Cloveshoe
(can. 18) in 747. Neither Chrodegang nor Theodulf
speak of Ember Days in their writings, though they seem
to have been introduced by St Boniface into Germany
and France. Even if the so-called statutes of St
Boniface are not in all points contemporary with
the saint, Ember Days were certainly enjoined in the
Frankish Empire by the Capitulary of Charlemagne
in 769, where up till then they had not been observed.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
The circumstance, too, that their observance had to be
repeatedly enjoined by the Councils of the ninth century,
<i>e.g.</i> the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle in 813, and later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
ones, proves that they had not yet won their way as a
popular observance in northern countries.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, it still remained uncertain in which week
of the months in question the Ember Days should come.
In Rome they came in the first week of the month.
Elsewhere doubts arose as to what ought to be done
when the Ember Days in June came in Whitsun Week,
and as to whether one ought to fast when the 1st March
fell on a Thursday or Friday, the Wednesday falling
on the last day of February.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Gregory VII. put an end
to these variations by establishing the present usage.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<h5>2. <i>Litanies or Rogations</i></h5>

<p><i>Litaniæ</i> is the name given to solemn processions of
clergy and people accompanied by prayer at which
sacred pictures and emblems are carried. It was impossible
to perform such devotions in the days before
Constantine. But when Christianity became a recognised
religion they were quickly adopted, and all the
more so as the heathens had similar practices which they
performed frequently and at stated times.</p>

<p>Litanies were especially frequent in Rome. There,
during Lent, the Pope was wont to set out with his
assistants with great solemnity from his residence to
celebrate Mass in the various churches of the city.
Each day he went to a different church, where the halt
or station was made. A survival of this remains in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the word <i>Statio</i>, which appears so often in the missal.
This custom was abandoned in course of time.</p>

<p>Still some of these <i>litaniæ</i> found their way into the
regular worship of the Church, and have their place in
the ecclesiastical year, <i>i.e.</i> the procession on the 25th
April, St Mark’s day, called <i>litania major</i>, and those on
the three days before the Ascension, called <i>litania minor</i>.
The names are remarkable, for the <i>minor</i> lasts three
days and the <i>major</i> only one, but it is explained by the
history of their institution.</p>

<p>The Christian processions are a continuation of the
heathen processions which they have replaced. This is
especially clear with regard to the <i>litania major</i> which
was performed on a stated day, the 25th April. It has
nothing to do with St Mark, whose feast was only much
later introduced in the Roman Church.</p>

<p>The ancient Romans had their processions which took
place both within and without the city, the latter
corresponding to our rogation processions; the former
were called <i>amburbalia</i> from <i>urbs</i>, and the latter <i>ambarvalia</i>
from <i>arva</i>.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> They served as supplications either
for blessings from the gods on the fruits of the earth,
and were observed yearly on stated days, or to avert
calamities and were appointed as need required.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>The better known of these processions of ancient Rome,
the <i>ambarvalia</i>, took place on vii. a. Kal. Maias (25th
April). The procession passed along the <i>Via Flaminia</i>,
the present Corso, and went as far as the fifth milestone,
<i>i.e.</i> as far as the Milvian Bridge, where, the entrails
of a dog and of a sheep were offered to the god <i>Robigus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
As the procession was primarily intended to ward off
blight (<i>robigo</i>) from the crops the day was called “<i>Robigalia</i>”
in the Calendar. When Rome became a great
city, agriculture and its festivals fell unto the back
ground, and both in the Calendar of the fourth century
and in that of Polemius Silvius the <i>Robigalia</i> is no longer
mentioned on this day. There was another great procession
in heathen Rome, the <i>Argea</i>, which took place
on the 16th and 17th March, and Bishop Vigilius of
Trent, speaks of a rural festival of the same character.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>As to Christian Rome, Rupert of Deutz is of opinion
that processions had been performed there since Constantine’s
days, and Beleth names Liberius as their
originator. Although it is not impossible these writers
may have gained their information from ancient sources,
still one cannot draw any certain conclusion from their
remarks.</p>

<p>We have, however, sure proof of the introduction
of Rogations by Bishop Mamertus of Vienne. That
part of the country had been visited for a considerable
period by various calamities and earthquakes. On
Easter night, 469, the royal palace in Vienne was
struck by lightning, which caused such a panic among
the entire congregation assembled in church, that they
fled from the building. Mamertus put himself into
connection with the civil authorities and along with them
organised the Litanies, which had been used before this
time, but in an informal and irregular manner. It was
ordained they should take place on the three days before
the Ascension, that they should be accompanied by a
fast, and that the slaves should do no servile work. This
institution was soon imitated throughout the whole
of Gaul. Under Bishop Sidonius Apollinaris they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
adopted at Clermont, next the first Council of Orleans
(511), in its twenty-seventh canon, prescribes them for
the Frankish part of the country, and Avitus could say
they had already spread throughout the whole
world, and been accepted with eagerness.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless there is no clear evidence in antiquity,
to show how matters were arranged in Rome. Only
when we come to the time of Gregory the Great, do we
get detailed accounts which have been preserved by
Gregory of Tours. In autumn of the year 589, a
terrible inundation devastated the city of Rome, overthrowing
the ancient buildings, destroying all provisions,
and leaving behind it a pestilence which carried away
Pope Pelagius II. in February 590. To avert the divine
wrath, Gregory, as administrator of the vacant see,
ordered a procession of especial solemnity.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> It was
apparently the procession of the 25th April, but carried
out on a larger scale than heretofore. It may, however,
have been an extraordinary procession such as had never
before taken place, for its date is unknown, and it is not
certain if the often quoted statement of Gregory really
refers to it. In his numerous letters there is no mention
of this procession.</p>

<p>Gregory prepared the people for the procession some
days before by a sermon. The procession was divided
into seven parts, and hence received the name of
<i>Litania Septiformis</i>. Each division started from a
different church, and all met in the basilica of St Mary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Major. As Gregory says in another place, “The return
of this annual solemnity warns us to keep it with devout
hearts,” we conclude it was not a new observance just
introduced.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> In Rome the <i>litaniæ</i> of Rogation Week,
as the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i> informs us, were first adopted
under Leo III. (795-816), through the Frankish influence<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
then dominant there. The observance of days of
penitence in this season of the year was a departure
from the original principle that the Quinquagesima was
a time of ecclesiastical joy, as Amalarius rightly observes.
The procession of the 25th April belonged especially to
the city of Rome, and the name <i>litania major</i> is due to the
fact that the processions of Rogation Week were only
introduced later. They too were performed with great
solemnity. In other places there were yet other days
appointed for litanies, but whether in addition to those
already mentioned or in place of them is not clear.
Thus the second Council of Lyons in 567, in its sixth
canon, enjoined that in the first week of November,
litanies similar to those customary before the Ascension
should be performed. The Church of Milan celebrated
the Rogations in the week after the Ascension. The
Council of Gerunda in 517, in its second canon, places
them in the week after Pentecost, and a second <i>litania</i>
on the first of November when it was not a Sunday
(Ib., Can. 3). The second canon of the sixth Council
of Toledo (638) places them on the Ides of December.
It may be conjectured from this that the litanies in
Spain developed on peculiar lines.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Here as in Gaul,
the Rogation Days were kept as fasts. In Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
the Rogations were only introduced in the ninth
century, for the Council of Mainz in 813 (Can. 33),
prescribed they should be observed by a three days’ fast,
and the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle in 836 (Can. 11),
ordered expressly the performance of the processions
after the Roman manner.</p>

<h5>3. <i>The Dedication of a Church and the Festival of the
Patron Saint</i></h5>

<p>The festival of the dedication of a Church has indeed
no connection with the ecclesiastical year, and the
festival of the patron saint belongs to the same category
as the ordinary saints’ days, but formerly, and even to
some extent at the present time, both have such a
marked position among the festivals that they deserve
some special mention.</p>

<p>In order to distinguish one church from another,
different ways of naming them were adopted in course of
time. In Rome they took their names originally from
their founders and from those to whom the site on which
they stood had previously belonged, <i>e.g.</i>, the Basilica of
the Lateran, the Sessorian Basilica (Sta. Croce), the
Licinian Basilica (Sta. Bibiana), the Liberian (Sta.
Maria Maggiore), etc. Elsewhere they received their
names partly in the same way, and partly from other
reasons, as we see from the oldest churches in Jerusalem—the
<i>Martyrium</i> and Anastasis in the city, the Eleona
or Imbomon on the Mount of Olives, and the <i>Lazarium</i>
in Bethania, close to Jerusalem.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Churches built over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
the graves of martyrs, <i>Martyria</i>, were naturally called
after the saint over whose tomb they were erected, and as
many such churches served for ordinary divine worship,
it gradually became customary to call churches after a
saint, or to dedicate them specially to his honour.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Such was the custom in Carthage. From the point of
view of the historical development, one must consider
(1) the day on which the church was made over for
public use, and (2) the patron saint. The former was
the day of the church’s dedication or consecration. The
heathen, both civilised and barbarian, had been accustomed
to set apart the edifices erected for the service
of their gods by a special ceremony of consecration.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
Everyone knows with what magnificence Solomon
dedicated the first temple. Accordingly, it only was
to be expected that so symbolical a ceremony would be
adopted by the Church, and, as a matter of fact, immediately
after the cessation of persecution, under the
first Christian Emperor, we find the dedication of
churches performed with great display. We have an
example of this in the dedication of the Church at Tyre,
about which Eusebius has so much to say in his Ecclesiastical
History, having himself delivered a long and
very tedious and commonplace discourse on that
occasion. (Euseb., <i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, 10, 3 and 4.)</p>

<p>The dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
in Jerusalem in 335, was performed with remarkable
magnificence. After the Synod of the Eusebians at Tyre
in this year, many bishops at the invitation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
imperial representative proceeded to Jerusalem, for the
great basilica which Constantine had commenced to
build on Mount Calvary was now finished. The dedication
took place on the 14th September, the day on which
the Empress Helena had found the Holy Cross, and
which, as the Gallic Pilgrim states, was observed later
as an annual festival. Two anniversaries fell, in this
case, on the same day and consequently we are unable
to conclude that the anniversary of a church’s dedication
was at this time already celebrated as a regular
thing. It became customary to do so, however, shortly
afterwards both in the East and in the West.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> To the
same period belongs the consecration of the so-called
Golden Basilica at Antioch, also commenced by Constantine
but completed under Constantius in 341. On
this occasion also a Synod was held.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately nothing definite regarding the ceremonies
employed at the dedication of a Church can be
gathered from Eusebius’ wordy description. He says:
“The bishops performed the divine service, and the
priests fulfilled their functions, and very magnificent
were the ecclesiastical ceremonies. One heard the
psalms and the other hymns which come from God,
and saw the mystic rites of the service performed; the
mystical symbols of the saving Passion were there also.
Moreover each of the bishops present delivered a festal
address and strove to the best of his ability to promote
the festivity.” In the West, even in the fourth century,
special ceremonies of dedication were in use, and Ambrose
mentions them as generally observed, but the particulars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
of which they were composed, we cannot now ascertain.
However, one of the ceremonies was the placing of relics
of the martyrs in the new church, if there were not some
there already. In an unconsecrated church there could
be no performance of divine service.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>Before this, and in many places afterwards, it appears
that the consecration of the altar alone was required.
At least the oldest Gallic missal<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> contains a mass for
the consecration of an altar only, and none for the
dedication of a Church. This is borne out by the fact
that in the liturgical writings of Ephrem and of the
pseudo-Dionysius we find mention of the consecration
with holy oil of the altar, while nothing is said of the
consecration of churches. Neither the Apostolic Constitutions
nor the so-called Testament of Jesus Christ
contain any reference to it.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> The Old Testament
furnished models for the elaboration of the liturgical
services used at the dedication of churches; in particular,
the octave and the annual commemoration of the
dedication day follow Jewish precedents.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The impressive
solemnities with which Solomon dedicated the
first temple in the twelfth year of his reign lasted for
seven days (iii. Kg. viii. 65). When the second temple,
built by Zorobabel, had been defiled by the heathen
rites of the Syrians, it was purified by Judas Machabeus,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 165, and restored to the worship of Jehovah. It
was then settled that the festival of this purification of
the temple should be observed annually for eight days,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
beginning on the 25th Casleu (1 Mach. iv. 42 <i>et seq.</i>, 2
Mach. i, 9 and 18).</p>

<p>The prolongation of the dedication festival for eight
days, and the recurring celebration of its anniversary soon
make their appearance in liturgical writings and spread
throughout all Christian countries. The Leonine
Sacramentary contains a mass for the anniversary of the
dedication of St Peter’s, the Gelasian Sacramentary has a
short rite for the consecration of a church along with
forms for the consecration of altars, chalices, and altar
cloths, but omits the blessing of the water.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> At the
consecration of a church in St Augustine’s time, the
twenty-ninth psalm was directed to be sung. We
possess three sermons preached by St Augustine at a
<i>Dedicatio</i> (336-338). In the text of the Gregorian
sacramentary, there is no Mass for the consecration of a
new church, but a special one for the anniversary.
That the latter was kept as a festival of obligation is not
stated. The form for the consecration of a church, with
the Mass belonging to it, is given in the Appendix.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>In the middle ages, the anniversary of the dedication
(<i>natale ecclesiæ</i>) was observed as a general festival of
obligation for the local congregation irrespective of
whether it fell on a week-day or on a Sunday; it was
also to be observed with an octave.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> In Germany it was
ordered by the Synod of Mainz in 813, and, along with
the feast of the Patron Saint, in the statute of Bishop
Hetto of Basel about 827. Both festivals are found
together in the statutes of Lanfranc of Canterbury and in
the decrees of the Council of Szabolcs in Hungary, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
1092. The ecclesiastical celebration consisted of a vigil,
solemn High Mass, and procession in which the relics of
the saints belonging to the church were carried. A flag
was wont to fly from the church tower, the floor was
strewn with green leaves, the altar and pulpit were decorated
with boughs, and a bunch of flowers was placed
before the picture of the Patron Saint. The anniversary
of the dedication of each altar was also observed, but
only inside the walls of the church.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>Festivals of the Patron Saints were not enjoined as of
obligation in the decretal of Gregory IX. in 1232,
although placed by Lanfranc in the highest class of
feasts. They were regarded as such in various countries,
especially throughout Germany. Thus, the diocesan
Synod of Cologne, under Archbishop Heinrich II.,
placed them along with the dedication of churches
among the holy days of obligation,<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and so also did the
statute of Archbishop Baldwin of Treves in 1338. On
the other hand, the provincial Synod of Cologne in 1549,
under Adolf III., expressly suppressed them as holy
days of obligation, and desired they should be celebrated
only in choir, in order, as it said, festivals should not
become too numerous. It also forbade noisy revels,
such as dancing, etc., at the festival of the dedication
of a church.</p>

<p>To have a church of its own, especially a parish
church, was of the greatest importance to each district,
on account of the spiritual and even material benefits
of which it was the source. This explains the enthusiasm
with which the dedication of the church was
observed. With the ecclesiastical festival were soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
associated secular amusements, fairs, merry-makings,
and shows. The dedication was especially the festival
of the people in the middle ages, and, as always happens
in such cases, the secular influences proved stronger than
the spiritual, although the dedication was one of the days
on which indulgences were usually granted.</p>

<p>As parishes and churches became more numerous,
the number of these festivals increased also, and the
result was that not only the parish in question observed
the feast, but all the neighbouring parishes joined in
the celebration. Thus these feasts and the merry-making
associated with them increased without limit.
Among the country people especially it was inevitable
that excess and licence should give rise to
grave disorders.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Reformation, the innovators
availed themselves of these abuses to wage war against
all Dedication Feasts,<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> and some provincial Synods of
the sixteenth century directed that all the dedications in
a diocese should be kept on one and the same day. In
the bull of Urban VIII. in 1642, reducing the number of
festivals, the dedication is no longer named among the
festivals which were to be retained. By a decree of
Clement XIV. in 1772, the festival of the Patron Saint
was to be celebrated on its proper day, and if there were
more than one patron, only the chief patron was to be
commemorated. The brief of Pius VI. of 1788 for
Breslau removed the festival of the Patron Saint out of
the range of the ordinary life of the people by transferring
its celebration to the Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Finally, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
French revolution and the Concordat abolished these
celebrations altogether, and put an end to all Dedication
Festivals throughout the extent of the French Empire.
This caused the churches in most dioceses to keep a
general Dedication Festival on some one Sunday in the
year, and only inside the walls of the church. The
dedication of the cathedral is either included in this
general celebration, or, in some instances as in Cologne,
is still celebrated by itself.</p>

<p>The people were by no means pleased at the suppression
of these popular feasts, but consoled themselves
by transferring to the festival of the Patron Saint, even
when transferred to the Sunday, the rejoicings which
they had hitherto associated with the Dedication
Festival.</p>

<p>In those parts of Germany which in 1802 did not
belong to France, the earlier usages continued and the
traditional rejoicings still continue to be observed, but
in a manner corresponding to the more refined spirit
of the time.</p>

<p>The custom of keeping the day of the Patron Saint
as a holiday of ecclesiastical and civil obligation still
continues in all the several Austrian crown lands. In
Bavaria each diocese celebrates the feast of the Patron
Saint of the diocese on the proper date.</p>

<p>As regards the present usage, the law for every parish
is that the feast of the patron of the church, or, if the
church is dedicated to a mystery, the day on which
that mystery is commemorated in the calendar, is to be
kept as a double of the first class with an octave. The
popular festival, called in Germany <i>Kirmes</i>, takes place
on the following Sunday. The existence of these
popular feasts to the present day, in spite of so much
opposition, proves their inherent right to exist, for each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
part of a great whole, having its own separate existence,
naturally wishes to have something distinctively its
own in addition to what it shares in common with
others.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE SAINTS’ DAYS</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>1. <i>The origins of the Cultus of the Saints and the Grounds
on which it Rests</i></h4>

<p>The ecclesiastical year recalls to the memory of the
faithful all that God has done for the salvation of mankind,
especially through the mysteries of the new
Covenant, <i>i.e.</i> the life and passion of Jesus Christ, and
she re-enacts them, as it were, before their eyes within
the compass of each recurring year. To this the
Sundays and festivals, especially those from Advent to
Pentecost, are devoted. They form an organic whole,
constituted in accordance with one definite idea, consisting
of the three great festivals Christmas, Easter, and
Pentecost, each in itself the centre of a special season.
The foundations and heart of the whole festal system of
the Church were given by a higher Hand, and only the
development—the much less important part of the whole—is
to be attributed to the thoughts and contrivances
of men.</p>

<p>It now remains for us to consider the second division
of the Christian festival system—the Saints’ Days.
These are distinguished from the feasts of our Lord both
by their institution and by their treatment, their distribution
throughout the year, their development and
their diffusion throughout Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>From the foundation of the Church, there has been no
controversy over the holiness and worshipfulness of those
who laid down their life for the Christian faith. The
New Testament itself did not omit to hand on to posterity
the memory of those whose death fell within the
apostolic period, such as the Holy Innocents, St James
the Great, and before all others the first martyr St
Stephen. The seer of the Apocalypse saw the martyrs
of Jesus beneath the altar of God, Who did not forget
them (Apoc. xvii. 6; vi. 9-11).</p>

<p>Neither did the Church forget them. From its
foundation each Christian congregation was at pains
to preserve the memory of the martyrs belonging to it.
Thus, for example, Pionius and his companions celebrated
the “true day” of St Polycarp’s death (<i>natale
genuinum</i>) at Smyrna in 250, during which festival they
were themselves seized and condemned to death.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
Among the larger congregations, where the number of
martyrs rapidly increased, special means were taken at
an early date to preserve their memory. This was
necessary in large communities if the memory of these
heroes of the Faith was not to pass away. It is true
that for the Church of Rome alone, do we possess
definite information as to her mode of proceeding in
this respect, but there is no room for doubt that smaller
communities followed on the same lines, and for some
indeed we have clear evidence that they did so. In
many instances, the reverence which continued to be
paid to the tomb of such an individual was sufficient
to keep his memory alive. Those who suffered a
shameful death as law-breakers in the opinion of the
civil power nevertheless received honourable burial.
According to Roman ideas earthly Justice was satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
by the death of the guilty person, the body was given
to the relations and friends to be duly buried.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Only
when there was risk of a tumult was this permission
withheld, which happened very rarely in the Roman
Empire before the reign of Diocletian—or, where it was
a question of high treason.</p>

<p>Not only the relations and friends were careful to
preserve the memory of the martyrs, but, as we have
already said, the congregation to which they had belonged.
While the former erected chapels over the
tombs of the martyrs, and preserved the information
relating to them, the community on its part marked
down in its registers their names and the days on which
they suffered. In large communities the Bishops took
steps for drawing up authoritative reports concerning
the martyrs belonging to their flocks. According to the
<i>Liber Pontificalis</i>, Clement I. is said to have divided
Rome into seven regions, with a Christian notary
appointed over each whose business it was carefully to
investigate matters of this nature belonging to his
region.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> The size of the city of Rome rendered this
necessary. Augustus had divided Rome for civil
purposes into fourteen regions, but Clement, for the
purpose he had in view, formed one region out of every
two. Pope Fabian again adopted similar measures,
and enjoined upon the seven sub-deacons the duty of
seeing that the seven notaries made a complete collection
of the acts of the martyrs. He thus doubled the
number of persons employed in this matter, and placed
the subdeacons over the notaries.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> His predecessor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
Anteros (235-236) collected the <i>gesta martyrum</i>, and
carefully preserved the Acts of the martyrs, as we learn
from a somewhat obscure notice in the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
This is again referred to in the same work, where it is
stated that Pope Caius appointed the regions of the city
to the deacons during the Diocletian persecution.</p>

<p>St Cyprian adopted the same plan at Carthage during
the persecutions under Decius and Valerian. He ordered
the priests and deacons of Carthage not only to interest
themselves in every way on behalf of the faith of those
in prison, but also to take thought for the bodies of those
who died in bonds, even when they died without having
undergone torture, and also to keep a record of the name
and date of death of each one, in order that his memory
might be celebrated along with the memorials of the
martyrs.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The order to take down the date could be
easily obeyed everywhere, since in every city, Calendars
engraved on marble tablets were set up for public
use.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>We have an authoritative document of this kind in
the detailed account given by the communities of Lyons
and Vienne, of the martyrdoms which took place there
under Marcus Aurelius. Owing to its having been sent
to Asia Minor, Eusebius was able to utilise it and
incorporate the chief parts of it into his history of the
Church.</p>

<p>The same thing happened more or less everywhere;
the names of the martyrs belonging to the community
were entered in the Calendars of the Church, and their
memory was celebrated annually on the anniversary of
their death. These were the so-called <i>martyres recogniti</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> those who were recognised as martyrs by the community.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Each large community, especially the patriarchal
Churches, thus possessed their calendar of saints,
which became more and more full of names in process of
time. Authentic fragments of such calendars are contained
in the Roman <i>Depositio Martyrum</i>, which, along
with the <i>Depositio Episcoporum</i>, was compiled not later
than the episcopate of Liberius (352-354). Fuller, because
less ancient, is the Calendar of Carthage, dating
from the end of the fifth century or from the beginning
of the sixth, printed by Mabillon in his <i>Analecta
Vetera</i>,<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> and of which he treats in iii. 398, of this
work.</p>

<p>In the third century, Gregory Thaumaturgus, Bishop
of Neocæsarea in Pontus, was no less zealous than St
Cyprian in collecting information concerning the
martyrs. He travelled throughout the whole district,
inspiring the people everywhere with zeal for the celebration
of the memory of those who had suffered for the
faith.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> And thus in all the greater cities, catalogues of
the local martyrs were compiled, as Sozomen testifies
for two neighbouring towns, Gaza and Constantia.
Each of these two towns, he says, had their own bishop
and clergy, and also their own festivals of martyrs
and catalogues of the priests who had presided over
them.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>At a much later date, Maximus of Turin gives us
some interesting evidence concerning these attempts of
the different communities: “As we must celebrate the
general commemoration of all the holy martyrs, so, my
brethren, ought we to celebrate with special devotion
the feasts of those who shed their blood in our own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
locality. For while all the saints, wherever they may be,
assist us all, yet those who suffered for us intercede for
us in a special manner. For the martyr suffers not for
himself alone, but also for his fellow-citizens. By his
sufferings, he obtains for himself a reward in heaven, and
gives a good example to his fellow-citizens. He gains
rest for himself and salvation for them.”<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>The official cultus of the saints was at first confined to
the martyrs. The earliest example of the public worship
of saints, not martyrs, dates from the time of Pope
Symmachus, under whom, about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 500, a church was
built and dedicated to Pope Silvester and Martin of
Tours, in Rome, the <i>basilica Silvestri et Martini</i>.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>Our information concerning the martyrs is derived
from three sources<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>:—</p>

<p>1. The <i>Acta</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the report of the trial taken down by
the notary of the proconsul or procurator (<i>notarius</i>,
<i>commentariensis</i>, and <i>exceptor</i>), containing the accusation,
the examination, the depositions of the witnesses,
the description of the tortures employed and the judgment
given. Even in the time of Cicero the evidence of
the witnesses was taken down in writing, and during the
Empire full reports of both civil and criminal actions
were taken and preserved. A proclamation of the
Emperor Severus in 194, enjoins that these <i>acta</i> be
preserved, and be produced when required for ascertaining
the truth. Copies were given for payment to
people interested or concerned in the trial. Some of
these reports of the trials of the martyrs have come
down to us in their original form, and afford the most
valuable materials which we possess for the history of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
early Christian times. The best known are the <i>Acta
Proconsularia S. Cypriani</i>, along with the acts of
Pionius, Maximilian, and Marcellus, etc.</p>

<p>2. <i>Passiones</i>, <i>i.e.</i> an account of the imprisonment,
trial, and execution of the martyrs drawn up by Christian
eye-witnesses at the time or immediately afterwards.
They are worthy of all credit, for among the Romans
legal proceedings took place as a rule in public. It was
only under the later emperors that this publicity was
so far curtailed that the proceedings were conducted in
the basilicas or buildings set apart for that purpose.
The earliest and best-known examples of these Passions
are the letter of the church of Lyons to the churches of
Asia Minor, the <i>Passio S. Perpetuæ et Felicitatis</i>, the
<i>Martyrium Polycarpi</i>, etc.</p>

<p>3. Legends, <i>i.e.</i> narratives based upon documents of
the nature described above, and worked up by later
writers, either for the purpose of edification or from
the point of view of a historian. This class of writings
is very large, beginning with the account of the martyrdom
of St Ignatius. The writings, however, differ
endlessly as to their value, according to the knowledge
and authority possessed by the writers, and according
to their nearness to the date of the events described.
There were many martyrs whose sufferings were recorded
in no <i>acta</i> or <i>passiones</i>, but were imprinted upon the
memory of men, and became part of the traditions
handed down in the community, until they were finally
committed to writing. The later this took place, the
worse for the authenticity. For it was then that
anachronisms, alterations in titles, changes in the
persons, and other similar historical errors could more
easily creep into the narrative, as we know, in fact, they
have done in many instances. The historical sense was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
unfortunately lacking to the Franks and Byzantines,
as well as all idea of sound criticism.</p>

<p>A false kind of patriotism and national pride often
goes along with credulity, so that we find here and there
in literature of this kind even downright fabrications.
After the introduction of printing, by which literature
became more widely diffused and comparative criticism
was rendered possible, it at once became evident
among Catholics that error was mixed with truth, and
that a sifting of the one from the other was necessary,
and, in many cases, quite possible. In this province of
criticism, those who have most distinguished themselves
for judgment and insight are Launoi, Henschen, the
Bollandists, Tillemont, Baillet, Ruinart, and in more
modern times, Franchi di Cavalieri and others who have
avoided extremes in either direction.</p>

<p>The matter from these writings incorporated in the
service books possesses the same historical value as the
source from which it is drawn. For, as Bäumer justly
remarks, “it was not the intention of the Church, or of
the compilers and authors of the service books, to claim
historical authority for their statements. And so the
Popes themselves have directed many emendations to be
made in the legends in the Breviary, although many
others still remain to be effected.”<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> The legends, by
their incorporation into the Breviary, gain no higher
degree of credibility than that which the person who
incorporated them is able to confer upon them from a
purely natural standpoint. This must be emphasised
and maintained, for since the time of Bishop Aurelian of
Arles,<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> the reading of the histories of the martyrs made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
its way more and more into the psalmody in the West,
and became an essential part of the Breviary.</p>

<p>The honour of having cultivated for the first time the
province of hagiography as a whole and not merely in a
few particulars, belongs, as far as we know, to the
historian Eusebius. Before he completed his history
of the Church, he planned a collection of the Acts of
the Martyrs (συλλοωὴ τῶν μαρτυρίων), which he
quotes in his history (v. 1, 6). Unfortunately this compilation
has been lost, although it was probably used by
Gregory of Tours.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> He gives further information in his
work on the martyrs of Palestine which took place
in his own lifetime during the Diocletian persecution,
between 303 and 310. This book seems to have been
composed after the completion of his History of the
Church.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Had we similar writings of the same period
relating to other provinces of the Church, we should be
better informed concerning those extraordinary events.</p>

<p>The method adopted was plainly that each local community
worked for itself alone without troubling itself
about what happened elsewhere. The worship of the
martyrs was also at first limited to particular localities.
Certainly there was no lack of interest in what took place
in other districts, as is shown by the letter from the
churches of Lyons and Vienne to the Christians of Asia
Minor, but liturgical and ecclesiastical worship was paid
to the martyrs of the place alone. For example, the
Calendar of the Roman Church contained those martyrs
alone who belonged to the Roman community; in the
same way the Alexandrian Calendar contained only those
belonging to Egypt, the Antiochene Calendar only those
of Syria, and so on. This state of things continued until
the ninth century. A striking proof of this is the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
that Ignatius of Antioch, although he suffered death in
Rome, finds no place in either the <i>Gelasianum</i> or the
<i>Gregorianum</i>, while at Antioch he was venerated as a
saint from the beginning. A remarkable exception is
the veneration which St Perpetua, St Felicitas, and St
Cyprian enjoyed in Rome. In this case the relationship
between the mother and the daughter church must be
taken into account, for Christianity had spread to
Carthage from Rome. From what has been said, it
follows that information concerning the manner of a
martyr’s death and the exact day on which he suffered,
derived from local sources, is trustworthy in the highest
degree, but it is forthcoming in a few cases only.</p>

<p>As it was the day of the martyr’s death which was
kept and marked in the calendar, it must be observed
that this day was sometimes called the martyr’s birthday,
<i>natalis</i>, <i>natalitium</i>, and sometimes also <i>dies depositionis</i>.
Owing to the burial taking place on the day
of death, as was the custom among the ancients, <i>dies
obitus</i> and <i>dies depositionis</i> could be used as synonymous
terms.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>Among the Romans burial followed as soon as the
death was certified. Nearly every one belonged to a
burial society, which undertook the preparations for the
funeral. In addition to these, there were only the
preparations in the house to be thought of, and these—the
washing and clothing of the corpse—could be
quickly performed. Hence the burial could take place
in a very short time. The Jews also buried their dead
immediately after death, as the story of Ananias and
Saphira shows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>The Christians of the first centuries followed out all
the customs relating to burial usual in their time and
country, excluding only those which were specifically
heathen and idolatrous. That they buried their dead
with the same expedition as the heathen is clear from
an incident related by Tertullian.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The burial of a
woman who seemed to be dead was for some reason
delayed. While she lay ready for burial and the priests
were reciting the prayers, she raised up both her hands,
and, when the prayer for peace was concluded, laid
them down again in their former position. It was only
in the fourth century that it began to be the custom to
delay burial to the third or fourth day after death,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
but the earlier practice continued still to exist for a
considerable period.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>As it was already the custom to inter those who died
a natural death on the day of their decease, so there was
no reason why the burial of the martyrs should be
delayed, and thus with them the <i>dies obitus</i> and the <i>dies
depositionis</i> were one and the same. Consequently the
ancient dates in question, even when given as that of
the burial, are always to be understood as referring to
the day of the martyr’s death, and, when they form
part of the traditions of the community to which
the martyr belonged, they are to be received as
absolutely reliable.</p>

<p>In the case of the martyrs, the rule of venerating them
on the day of their death admitted of no exception,
although it might be set aside in the case of those
saints who were not martyrs, for certain reasons and in
particular instances. Thus, for example, the day of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
St Chrysostom’s death, the 14th September, was already
occupied in the fourth century by the festival of the
Invention of the Holy Cross. St Basil died on the 1st
January, and St Ambrose on the 4th April, which fell
within the Pascal season. During Lent, no festivals
of martyrs were to be celebrated on week-days, according
to the fifty-first Canon of Laodicea, but only on Saturdays
and Sundays at most. But this prohibition was
by no means general.</p>

<p>Besides the lists of the <i>depositiones</i>, the service-books,
the sacramentaries or missals, helped to preserve the
memory of the martyrs.</p>

<p>In the earliest service-books of the Roman and also of
a few other churches, the Masses in honour of the
martyrs were not classed by themselves apart, but were
incorporated with the others, and not separated from the
course of the ecclesiastical year, or, to use a modern
expression, the <i>Proprium de Sanctis</i> and the <i>Proprium de
Tempore</i> were still fused together. Only in the <i>Gelasianum</i>
are the <i>Natalitia sanctorum</i> separated from the
ecclesiastical year and collected together in the second
volume. Still later were the catalogues of the saints
formed into independent works, the so-called martyrologies.
In the East these began to appear at an
early date. In this a return was made to the older
arrangement, except that now it was not the martyrs
of the local churches alone which were taken into
consideration, but those of the Church Universal.</p>

<p>It is just this insertion of the saints’ days in the
course of the Church’s year which proves that the names
of the martyrs and the days of the commemoration were
subject to the control of authority; that is to say, the
compilations in question have all the weight attaching
to public official documents and to reliable sources of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
information, and, for this reason, they may be used as
material in historical works. Valuable information can
be gained from a judicious employment of these compositions.</p>

<p>The restriction of festivals to those commemorating
saints of a specific locality disappeared only slowly, and
at a late date in the West. It disappeared still later,
and only to a limited extent, among the Easterns, who
showed a tendency to fill up their calendars with other
things rather than with the feasts of foreign martyrs
and saints, as, for example, the commemorations of
Councils, Old Testament personages, and even the four
beasts of the Apocalypse were pressed into the service.
In the West the entrance of the Franks and Anglo-Saxons
into the Roman Church gave the first impulse
to an extension of the martyrologies and calendars in the
direction of universalism or universal Catholicity.
Both these nations, having no Christian antiquity of
their own, adopted along with the ritual of the Roman
Church her calendar of saints as well. Soon, however,
they added to this the names of their own particular
saints, and so prepared the way for more universal ideas;
while, on the contrary, the Roman Church did not
include in her calendar the saints and martyrs of the
Franks and Anglo-Saxons. Only at the revision of the
service-books in the sixteenth century did she so far
yield as to act in some degree upon the principle
of Catholicity in this matter. The subsequent increase
and development of the festivals of the saints in the
Calendar of the Catholic Church had a disturbing effect
upon the ecclesiastical year and daily office. Ordinary
Sundays have lost their position and have given place to
the commemoration of saints, and green vestments only
rarely make their appearance. The first step towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
the general observance of the cultus of particular saints
throughout the Church, and the admission of other than
merely local saints to a place in the devotions of each
community, may have been effected by the Litanies
which came into use in France. The oldest form of a
Litany of the Saints is contained in the prayer-book of
Charles the Bald.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>The saintly personages of the Old Testament have
really the same right to veneration as those of the New,
being justified through faith in the future Messias,
many of them were martyrs, and all attained to the
Beatific Vision after our Lord’s resurrection. They
are on this account called blessed by St Paul in Heb. xi.
4-39. The synagogue paid no worship to saints, but
honoured the memory of the prophets so far as to erect
monuments over their graves (St Matt. xxiii. 29).
Accordingly there was nothing to prevent the same
cultus being paid to them as to the saints of the New
Testament, yet nevertheless it remained exceptional.
Eastern calendars contain the names of many Old
Testament worthies, Western calendars only a few,
and the Roman Church commemorates none with the
exception of the Machabees. But even the Eastern
Churches have appointed no days in their honour, and
so this part of the worship of the saints lies without the
scope of this work.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<h4>2. <i>The Festivals of St John the Baptist and St Stephen
the Proto-Martyr</i></h4>

<p>In saying that in antiquity the worship of the martyrs
was confined to the localities to which they belonged,
it must be borne in mind that this rule admitted of two
exceptions from the first. St John the Baptist and St
Stephen the Proto-martyr, were honoured throughout
the whole Christian Church from the beginning; their
commemoration was universally celebrated, and even
the former was regarded as a martyr in the ecclesiastical
sense of the word.</p>

<p>The Baptist had at once been designated by his father
in a moment of prophetic inspiration as a prophet and
the Forerunner of the Lord, and later on he received from
our Lord Himself the recognition of his remarkable
sanctity (St Matt. xi. 11). Accordingly it causes no
surprise to find proof of his worship and his festivals at a
very early date. The latter already appear in the
sermons of St Augustine as <i>solemnitates</i>, and as fixed
on definite dates. Indeed, in course of time a regular
little cycle of festivals of the Baptist came into existence.
The date of his birth, for instance, was fixed by that of
our Lord, as falling six months before Christmas; nine
months earlier came the date of his conception,<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> and, in
addition to these, the day of his death was celebrated on
the 29th August, under the title of <i>Passio</i> or <i>Decollatio</i>.</p>

<p>The festival of St John’s birth does not appear indeed
in the Calendars of Philocalus and Polemius Silvius,
although it is found in the most ancient calendar of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
African Church, and in the list of festivals drawn up by
Perpetuus of Tours. Among the sermons of St Peter
Chrysologus and Maximus of Turin there are also to be
found many allusions to it. It was numbered, by the
Council of Agde in 506, among the chief feasts on which
all the faithful must attend divine service in their parish
churches and not in private oratories.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> In the Middle
Ages servile work was proscribed on it,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> and until our
own times it continued universally to rank as a high
festival, but at the present time it is kept as such in only
a few countries, as we have observed on page 35.</p>

<p>The festival of the Baptist’s conception was celebrated,
especially in the East, and appears in the
Calendars of Calcasendi and of the Syrians, also in the
Neapolitan Calendars, and in that of Silos as well as in
the Mozarabic Calendar, in the Calendar of Bede, in the
Greek calendars, and in both menologies, <i>i.e.</i> that of
Constantinople and that of Basil. Its introduction<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
at an early date is due to the circumstance that St John’s
conception was announced by the angel, and also to the
supposition, which appears as early as St Augustine,
that by the meeting of his mother with Mary he was
already purified from original sin before his birth.</p>

<p>The 29th August was kept as the commemoration of
his death at an early date, both in Africa and in the East.
The collection of St Augustine’s sermons contains two
sermons for this festival (307 and 308), and it has its
place among the festivals in the list of Perpetuus. The
same date is given in the Coptic Calendar in Selden, in
the Syrian, Neapolitan, and Mozarabic. As regards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Rome, it had not yet made its way into the Leonine
sacramentary, though it is found in the <i>Gelasianum</i>.</p>

<p>In addition, a so-called <i>synaxis</i> of St John the Baptist
is marked in the two Greek menologies. This is an
instance of a peculiar custom among the Greeks, according
to which, after certain chief feasts of our Lord and
our Lady, there is held a second festival, or <i>synaxis</i>, on
the following day, in honour of the personages who had
taken part in the event commemorated by the feast.
Thus with the feast of the 2nd February is coupled that
of St Simeon, with that of the Nativity of our Lady, the
feast of Joachim and Anna, and here, after Epiphany,
the day of Christ’s baptism, we have the feast of St John
the Baptist, on the 7th January.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The cultus of St John the Baptist received a great
extension throughout the whole Church in the fourth
and fifth centuries, owing to the discovery of his relics.
The records of the Church contain much information
concerning both the discovery and the translation
of these relics, though they give rise to insoluble
difficulties.</p>

<p>In the first place one must bear in mind how the
disciples of St John, on hearing of the death of their
teacher in the fortress of Machærus,<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> came and took
his body and buried it (St Matt. xiv. 12; St Mark vi.
29). The head doubtless remained at first in the
keeping of Herodias, who had accepted it as a present.
According to a creditable tradition, Samaria was the
place of St John’s burial, as it was outside the limits of
Herod’s tetrarchy, and under the jurisdiction of the
Roman governor. The remains reposed there until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
persecution of Julian in 362, when the pagan rabble
violated the tomb and burnt the remains. A portion of
them, however, was saved by monks and carried to
Alexandria, where Athanasius deposited them provisionally
in a church. Later on they were placed in
the church erected by the Patriarch Theophilus in
honour of the Baptist in the ruins of the destroyed
Serapeum. The dedication of this church followed
on the 27th May 385 or 386.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> Tillemont was inclined
to regard the 29th August as the day of the translation,
which in this case as in others came to be regarded
as the ecclesiastical commemoration of the event.
Against this, however, is the fact that the more ancient
Coptic Calendars know nothing of the 29th August as a
feast of the Baptist.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the saint’s head, there are two different
accounts in existence. According to one account, given
by Sozomen (7, 21), it is said to have been found in
Jerusalem in the possession of monks belonging to the
sect of the Macedonians, who carried it to Cilicia, when
they were driven out from that city. When the Emperor
Valens heard of this, he despatched an official to convey
the relic to Constantinople. As they approached
Chalcedon, the mules which drew the vehicle in which
the messenger travelled with the relic refused to proceed
any further, and all efforts to continue the route were
unavailing—a circumstance frequently repeated in later
legends. Valens and his court regarded this as miraculous
and did not venture to bring the relic near the city.
Accordingly it remained in a village near Chalcedon in
charge of adherents of the Macedonian sect, until the
reign of Theodosius, who brought it to Hebdomon, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
suburb of Constantinople, where he had a church
erected in honour of the Baptist.</p>

<p>The Paschal Chronicle makes mention of this translation
in 391, as well as of another under the date 453,
without throwing any light on the connection of the
one with the other. This second translation, of which
Rufinus also speaks (“Hist. Eccl.” 2, 28), is said to have
come about in the following manner.</p>

<p>The head is reported to have been brought from
Machærus to Jerusalem and there buried. In the
time of Constantine it was taken to Emesa and
hidden away in a cave. Why this was necessary at
that particular period is not stated. Here it was
discovered by a priest called Marcellus, the superior
of a monastery in those parts. He composed a
long and detailed account of the discovery, containing
also a history of the previous vicissitudes
of the relic.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The discovery was made in consequence
of many dreams, and a fiery star is said to have
guided Marcellus to the spot where the sacred treasure
rested in an urn, deeply buried in the earth. Marcellus
informed Bishop Uranius of Emesa of his discovery, and
the bishop solemnly removed the relic on the 24th
February, 452. It was first of all placed in the cathedral,
and then soon afterwards in a chapel expressly built to
receive it, to which it was conveyed on the 26th September
of the same year. Here it rested under the
Mohammedan dominion, and in 760 a large church was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
even built to replace the chapel. We have here a threefold
translation of the head of St John the Baptist.
It is asserted that a part of it is preserved at Amiens
which was brought thither from Constantinople in
the thirteenth century. Two of the three days commemorating
these translations are marked in the Greek
menologies, the 24th February and the 26th September.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
The story of these translations throws no light upon the
choice of 29th August for the beheading of the saint.</p>

<p>From a liturgical point of view, the birth of the
Baptist was kept with special distinction at Rome in
earlier times. In the Leonine sacramentary it is
already provided with a vigil. Other saints’ days
indeed were similarly provided, but the vigil of St John
was to be kept as a fast, and, moreover, in addition to the
two formularies for the Mass of his feast, there are two
more specially intended for use in the Baptistery of St
John. As early as the fifth century in Rome, three
Masses seem to have been celebrated on St John’s Day
as on Christmas, one on the vigil after Vespers, one
during the night, and the third on the morning of the
24th June—this last being celebrated in the Baptistery.
In the <i>Gelasianum</i> we find only two Masses, one for the
vigil, and one for the day itself, but in the <i>Gregorianum</i>
we find three again to be said at special times, as in the
<i>Leoninum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Accordingly, Menard observes that Alcuin<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
also speaks of three Masses on St John’s Day commemorating
the three great triumphs—as he calls them—which
the Baptist had celebrated in preparing the way
for our Lord, in baptizing Him, and in having been a
Nazarite from his mother’s womb. The ordo of the
Canon Benedict of St Peter’s, belonging to the year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
1143, makes no mention of three Masses, though it
speaks of two offices.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> When the Council of Seligenstadt
in 1022 (cap. 1) prescribed abstinence for the
fourteen days before St John, it was acting without
precedent, and was influenced by the desire to make
the festival of the forerunner as like to Christmas as
possible.</p>

<p>As at Rome, so too in Latin North Africa, the Nativity
of the Baptist must have been celebrated with special
honour, for we possess no fewer than seven sermons of
St Augustine on it, and he distinctly speaks of it as a
festival which had come down from his predecessors.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Proto-martyr St Stephen.</span> The cultus of this
saint received also a great impulse from the discovery of
his relics at Kaphar-Gamala.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> This took place on the
5th December, in consequence of a revelation said to
have been made to a priest of Jerusalem called Lucianus,
in presence of John Bishop of Jerusalem, and of a Spanish
priest from Braga, named Avitus, who was then stopping
in Jerusalem. Lucianus wrote an account of the event
in the form of a letter to all the churches,<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> which Avitus
translated into Latin.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Whereupon the worship of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
first martyr spread, one might say, in every direction.
Pilgrims seeking relief from their sufferings visited his
churches and chapels, numerous answers to prayer and
miracles of healing followed, of which the sermons of St
Augustine and his work on the “City of God” afford
evidence.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Pope Simplicius († 483) erected a basilica
in St Stephen’s honour at Rome. The festival of the
discovery of his relics was fixed for the 3rd August.</p>

<p>Upon their discovery the relics were first taken to
Jerusalem, but portions of them were bestowed upon
other places, as, for example, a hand to the city of
Constantinople, or rather to the Emperor Theodosius
II.,<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> and smaller relics elsewhere. In the year 439
the Empress Eudocia brought the remaining relics to
Constantinople and had them placed in the basilica of
St Lawrence.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Over the tomb a chapel was erected,
well known to pilgrims of the sixth century as the grave
of St Stephen.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> St Augustine, in the passages already
quoted, speaks of churches erected in St Stephen’s
honour in many places.</p>

<p>The worship of St Stephen, however, does not date
merely from this period, but was much older, and may
even be said to be as old as the Church herself, since St
Paul gave him the title of “Martyr of Christ” (Acts
xxii. 20). Many churches and chapels were dedicated
to him in Constantinople, of which the oldest was built
by or under Constantine, if Codinus is rightly informed.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>Apart from this, his name is to be found already in
the earliest liturgical sources, <i>e.g.</i> the Arian martyrology,
belonging to about 360, and in all Calendars ancient
and modern excepting the Coptic Calendars, published<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
by Selden and Calcasendi. A remarkable variation is
observable with respect to the date, for the most ancient
Calendars and also the Roman give it invariably as the
26th December, while the Eastern Calendars give it
sometimes on the 27th, <i>e.g.</i> the two menologies of
Constantinople and the Syrian lectionary. It cannot
now be ascertained whether one of these days was the
day of his martyrdom or not; it is not impossible, but
it must be observed that the Coptic Calendar given in
Mai notices only a discovery of his relics on the 27th
December, with which agrees a later tradition of the
Egyptian Church.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Accordingly the 26th or 27th
December may have been observed as only the day of a
translation of St Stephen’s relics.</p>

<h4>3. <i>Festivals of our Blessed Lady in General</i></h4>

<p>The unique position occupied by the Blessed Virgin
Mary in the scheme of salvation called for a corresponding
recognition from the Church in the development
of her festal system. As a matter of fact the
Church has amply discharged this duty, inasmuch as not
only the events in our Lady’s life recorded in Scripture
have been made the occasion of festivals, but others
also not mentioned therein. A considerable period, however,
elapsed before this work was accomplished. This
circumstance has been explained by reference to the
fact that the Church, while paganism was still in power,
refrained from publicly honouring the parents of our
Lord after the flesh, on account of the myths and
genealogies current about the gods. More weight may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
be given to the circumstance that the facts relating to
the life of Jesus and the redemption He accomplished
had first to be commemorated by fixed festivals before an
extension of the Calendar in other directions could be
thought of. Then again, in the early ages, it was felt
to be an imperative duty to duly honour the commemorations
of the numerous martyrs, and the custom of
appointing days for the commemoration of saints not
martyrs only came into existence later.</p>

<p>The cultus paid to the Mother of God by the Church
existed long before the institution of her feasts, for
Constantine is said to have built three churches in her
honour in his new capital. According to recent investigations,
a Church dedicated to her, Maria Antiqua,<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
is said to have existed in Rome before the erection of the
Liberian basilica, generally reckoned as the oldest
Church of our Lady in the Eternal City. It is certain
that Ephesus had a noteworthy Church of our Lady
in 431, in which the third Ecumenical Council held
its meetings.</p>

<p>As regards festivals, all the churches of the ancient
patriarchates observe many of them, especially the
oriental Greeks and the Roman Catholic; the latter,
without question, observes the largest number. But
the ancient Church of Egypt also distinguished itself
by its zeal for the worship of our Lady, and in the Coptic
Calendars we find a <i>commemoratio Dominæ Virginis
Mariæ</i> on the 21st (corresponding to the 15th in the
Julian Calendar) of each month.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Formerly every
Saturday was generally dedicated to her. The first
certain instance of the observance of a festival in honour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
of the Mother of God, which has so far come to light, is
found in the panegyric on St Theodosius, preached by
Theodore about the year 500. In this it is stated that
a commemoration of the holy Mother of God (θεοτόκου
μνήμη) was celebrated annually in the Palestinian
monasteries, attended by a concourse of all the monks.
Unfortunately neither the date of this festival nor its
name is given, although there is good reason for thinking
that it was the feast of the 15th August, which had been
regarded as the day of our Lady’s death from the earliest
times.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> In Spain, in the time of Bishop Ildephonsus of
Toledo († 667), a festival of the Mother of God was
also solemnly observed. This prelate made penitential
processions (<i>litaniæ</i>) in the three preceding days, and
composed a special mass for the feast. Here again the
particular name of the feast is unfortunately not given.
Still it can only have been the feast of the 15th
August.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>The number of feasts of our Lady observed at the
present time in the Catholic Church is, as we have said,
considerable, among them being some which affect the
public life of the community and some whose observance
is confined to the four walls of the Church. They can also
be classified as greater and lesser, or, according to the
date of their institution, as earlier or later. Among the
greater feasts are the Conception, Birth, Annunciation
and Assumption of our Blessed Lady, and
Candlemas; among the lesser are the Presentation of
our Lady in the Temple, her Espousals, the Visitation,
and now the Feast of the Holy Rosary.</p>

<p>It is not, however, possible to speak, as many liturgists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
do, of a Marian ecclesiastical year. For the dates of our
Lady’s feasts, viewed in their chronological order, overlap
the limits of the year, and being subject to the same
principles which regulate saints’ days, fall invariably
on fixed days in the Calendar, and so cannot be said to
form an integral part of the ecclesiastical year. Nevertheless
they form in themselves a cycle of festivals, as is
also the case in a lesser degree with regard to St John
the Baptist. Two of them, however, have been brought
into connection, at least externally, with the ecclesiastical
year, <i>i.e.</i> the Annunciation, whose date depends
upon Christmas, and the Visitation, whose date is
regulated by the births of Christ and St John the Baptist.
The former interrupts the course of the Church’s year,
and falls within a cycle of feasts with which it has no
inner connection. The Conception of our Blessed Lady,
the latest in date of her great feasts, depends naturally
upon the date of her birth. Finally, nothing can be
said touching the grounds which led to the choice of
these dates, for no historical evidence for the first
institution of these festivals has come down to us.
They have been appointed and sanctioned by
custom.</p>

<p>We shall first deal with the great festivals of our Lady,
the observance of which affected public life. From
these we omit Candlemas, originally regarded rather
as a festival of our Lord. Three others—the Nativity,
Annunciation, and Assumption—can be considered together
as far as their institution is concerned, inasmuch
as they made their appearance in history at the
same period—that is to say, in the seventh century.
The reliable evidence for their introduction in
Rome is confined to the following; in the later
MSS. of the <i>Gregorianum</i> appears a notice which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
confines the work of Gregory the Great to the first
part of the sacramentary. This is the important preface
“Hucusque.”<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> In this it is stated the entire preceding
part of the book is due to Gregory I., with the
exception of what concerns the Nativity and Assumption
of our Lady, and a few other matters. From this
it follows that the sacramentary used in the time of
Gregory I. did not contain these two festivals of the
Mother of God.</p>

<p>They had been already introduced, however, by the
end of the seventh century. This is clear from the fact
that they appear in the <i>Gelesianum</i>, and, secondly, from
a statement in the life of Sergius I. (687-701),<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> to the
effect that this pope directed that on the Annunciation,
Nativity, and Assumption of our Lady, and in the
festival which the Greeks call <i>Hypapante</i>, a procession
(<i>litania</i>) should go from St Adrian’s to St Mary Major’s.
These festivals were at that time already observed in
Rome, when Sergius ordered these processions as adjuncts
to existing festivals. This comprises all the reliable
evidence at our disposal regarding these feasts of our
Lady.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>All that we can with certainty deduct therefrom is
that these three principal feasts of our Lady were introduced
in the Roman Church only in the course of the
seventh century. The sermons belonging to the same
period also support this conclusion. The rich collections
of sermons of St Augustine, St Leo the Great,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
Peter Chrysologus,<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Fulgentius, and Maximus of Turin,
contain no sermons for feasts of the Mother of God. All
the chief, and also the majority of the lesser, feasts of
our Lady had their origin rather in the East, and only
at a comparatively late date made their way into the
West. This also explains why none of them have been
incorporated, as most of them might easily have been,
into the ecclesiastical year. Their adoption by Rome
resulted from the political dependence of Italy on
Byzantium and from the intimate relations existing
between the Apostolic See and the Imperial Court.</p>

<h4>4. <i>The Three Ancient Festivals of our Blessed Lady—the
Nativity, the Annunciation, the Assumption</i></h4>

<h5>(1) THE NATIVITY OF OUR LADY</h5>

<p>The spread of this feast seems to have been retarded,
for it does not appear in many Calendars which contain
the Assumption, <i>i.e.</i> in the Gotho-Gallican, in that of
Luxeuil, in the Toledan Calendar of the tenth century,
and in the Mozarabic; that it is not to be found in
older Calendars goes without saying. On the other
hand, it appears along with the Assumption in the
<i>Gelasianum</i> and in the Frankish Calendars drawn up
under Roman influence in the Carolingian period, the
earliest being those of Reims and Bede. It cannot be
said to have been generally celebrated in the eighth and
ninth centuries, although in many places it makes its
appearance much earlier. Some writers have maintained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
that, on the whole, Fulbert of Chartres († 1028)
was the first to introduce it.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> But this is certainly
wrong. Nevertheless he probably exerted himself to
spread the observance of the feast in the northern parts of
France, since we have two sermons of his preached on the
feast, the oldest genuine Latin sermons on this festival,
as it seems. In Greek there are two sermons of Andrew
of Crete dealing also with the festival.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Evidence is
wanting to show why the 8th September was chosen for
the Nativity of our Lady.</p>

<h5>(2) THE ANNUNCIATION</h5>

<p>The official title of this feast is now <i>Annuntiatio B.
Mariæ Virginis</i>, but formerly other titles were used, <i>i.e.</i>
<i>Annuntiatio Angeli ad B.V.M.</i>, <i>Annuntiatio Domini</i>,<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
<i>Annuntiatio Christi</i>, or even <i>Conceptio Christi</i>, etc.,
showing that it was regarded more as a festival of our
Lord than of our Lady. That it owes its existence
entirely to Christmas, and depends upon the date (25th
December) assigned to the birth of Christ, requires no
proof. But the reference to Mary is so striking that it
could not fail to be regarded as essentially one of her
feasts.</p>

<p>It is well known that the custom of the ancient Church
was not to celebrate the festivals of martyrs and other
saints during Lent, which rule the Spanish Church
followed even with regard to this feast. But in Constantinople
an exception was made in its favour, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
was expressly approved by the fifty-second canon of the
Trullan Council. The feast is absent from the ancient
Gallican Missal and the Lectionary of Luxeuil, but in
Rome, according to the evidence afforded by the
<i>Gelasianum</i> and <i>Gregorianum</i>, the feast was observed on
the same date as in the East.</p>

<p>The feast of our Lady in Advent (S. Mariæ), noted,
without further specification, in the Lectionary of Silos
dating from about 650, can be no other than the
Annunciation. Soon afterwards, however, the tenth
Council of Toledo (656) took occasion to remark upon
the difference of date. External influences (<i>traducti
homines</i>) had been the cause. The Council decided in
favour of the date hitherto observed in Spain, and
ordained in its first canon that the feast should
be celebrated throughout Spain eight days before
Christmas—on the 18th December.</p>

<p>But in the East the other date was already so widely
observed that it was even employed as a fixed indication
of time, as, for example, when the Alexandrian
Paschal Chronicle states in 624 that Heraclius and his
forces started for the East on the day of Mary’s Annunciation.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
This, along with other indications, shows
that in the East the festival had been earlier adopted
and was widely spread. A circumstance of special
importance is that the schismatic Armenians, whose
ecclesiastical year in other respects is very primitive in
character, observe this feast. They keep it, however, on
the 7th April. This is due to the fact that they have not
adopted Christmas, and still celebrate the birth of Christ
in the ancient manner on the 6th January. Counting
back nine months from this date one arrives at the 7th
April. The Armenians certainly celebrated this festival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
before their separation from the Church. It was known
and loved in the East as early as the fifth century, as
the sermons of Proclus, Patriarch of Constantinople
(† 446), and of Peter Chrysologus of Ravenna († 450),
prove.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>Both methods of dating the festival existed side by
side for a long period. The majority was in favour of
the 25th March, but the other date was not without
supporters, especially in Upper Italy, for according
to the Milanese rite the <i>Annuntiatio</i> falls in Advent,
and, indeed, on the fourth Sunday. In southern
France the difference in date gave rise to sundry differences
and disputes which terminated in a victory for
the Roman usage. Certain Spanish monks, who came
to Cluny under Abbot Odilo, desired to celebrate the
festival after their own fashion, which was at first
allowed them. In the eleventh century several
Councils occupied themselves with the question, and
decided, obviously out of regard for Rome, for the
25th March.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>A further consideration of the question shows that
an agreement was arrived at by both parties. The
Spaniards, in their <i>Missale Mixtum</i>, celebrated the feast
twice—on the 18th December and the 25th March—with
the same Mass,<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and in Rome, in eighteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
the feast of the <i>Expectatio Partus B.M.V.</i>, was placed on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the 18th December, the Gospel for the Mass being that of
the Annunciation.</p>

<p>The sermons of Proclus already referred to give rise
to an important observation. This preacher in other
passages of his works enumerates the festivals celebrated
in his time and in his diocese, among which, strange to
say, the Annunciation does not appear.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Since there
are not only two sermons of his composed for this feast,
but the day itself is clearly marked out as a festival,
this contradiction can only be explained by the fact that
in the fifth century the Annunciation was kept simply
as a festival inside the Church, but had not yet won its
way to public recognition.</p>

<p>If the conception of the ecclesiastical year taken in
Section I. of this chapter be assumed as correct, the
Annunciation is most suitably observed in Advent, where
it was correctly placed in the ancient Spanish liturgy.
But owing to the fact that the Eastern Church did
not sufficiently carry out the idea which underlay the
ecclesiastical year, the feasts of our Lady were not
incorporated therein, but were treated as ordinary
saints’ days by being tied down to fixed dates. And
so it comes to pass that with us the Annunciation, instead
of coming in Advent, falls in Lent, and from time to
time even in Holy Week, where it is singularly out of
place. In North America, when this feast falls on one
of the three last days of Holy Week or in Easter Week,
it is now transferred, which on the whole may be regarded
as a desirable arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<h5>(3) THE DEATH AND ASSUMPTION OF OUR LADY</h5>

<p>In all probability this is the earliest of our Lady’s
feasts. From the beginning, there was a general
sentiment in the Church which led to the days on which
the martyrs suffered being kept as solemn commemorations.
The same thing took place at a later date with
regard to the other classes of saints—confessors, virgins,
etc.—and so Christian sentiment was soon directed
towards the question of our Blessed Lady’s death. It is
highly probable, if not certain, that the feast of our Lady,
mentioned above as having been celebrated by the monks
in Palestine, was that which we are now considering.
Both in the East and in Rome the 15th August was
kept as the day of our Lady’s death, while we find
another date observed in Gaul.</p>

<p>As regards the references to the decease of the Holy
Virgin found in patristic literature, we find Epiphanius
alluding to it, but in such general terms as to show he
knew nothing about it for certain.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Then we have a
letter of the so-called Areopagite Dionysius containing
the essential points of the tradition for the death and
burial of the Holy Virgin, which we find later on
in St John Damascene. The date of this letter depends
upon the view taken of the author and date
of the pseudo-Dionysian writings. The garden of
Gethsemani is named as the place of burial.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The same
tradition appears in the apocryphal Apocalypse on the
“<i>transitus</i>” of Mary, where the year of her death is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
given as the third after our Lord’s resurrection,<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> while
other authorities give it as the twelfth.</p>

<p>The chief authority, however, for the event is St John
Damascene. Relying on the history of an otherwise
unknown Euthymius, he describes the circumstances in
detail. According to this informant, Pulcheria, wife
of the Emperor Marcian (450-457), had erected a Church
in honour of the Holy Virgin in the suburb of Constantinople
called Blachernæ, to which she wished to
translate the earthly remains of our Lady. With this
end in view, she addressed herself to Bishop Juvenal of
Jerusalem during the sitting of the Council of Chalcedon,
but he informed the Emperor and Empress that the body
of the Mother of God was not to be found in Jerusalem.
She had indeed been buried there in the Garden of
Gethsemani in the presence of all the Apostles;
Thomas alone was absent, and only arrived on the third
day after the burial; in order that he too might
venerate the body of the Mother of God, the tomb was
opened, but nothing was found save the linen grave-clothes,
which gave forth a fragrant perfume. Whereupon
the Apostles concluded that our Lord had taken
up into heaven the body which had borne Him. In
his panegyric on the Holy Virgin, Modestus, Patriarch
of Jerusalem († 634), states that already in the seventh
century there was a special festival in Jerusalem to
celebrate her decease (κοίμησις). In addition, we have
sermons dealing with this event by Andrew of Crete († 720
<i>circ.</i>) and Germanus, Patriarch of Constantinople († 733).<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
The bodily assumption of Mary into heaven was already
known in the West in the sixth century, and is alluded
to in Gregory of Tours.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor Maurice is said to have appointed the
festival of our Lady’s death (κοίμησις τῆς παναγίου καί
θεομητέρος), and fixed it on the 15th August. Although
this information is given by an historian of a much later
date,<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> it must not be altogether set aside. Maurice may
well have given official recognition to the festival, and
by so doing settled the question of the day on which it
was to be kept. The festival itself was, however, much
older, for not only the heretical sects, which separated
from the Church in the fifth century, such as the Monophysites
and Nestorians, preserved this festival at the time
of their separation, but most ancient national Churches,
such as the Armenian and Ethiopian, have it in their
Calendars. Accordingly the 15th August must have already
been generally regarded in the Church as the day of
our Lady’s death before the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon,
although not mentioned by historians of that time.</p>

<p>We have unfortunately no information concerning the
introduction of this festival in Rome. All we know is that
it was celebrated there along with our Lady’s Nativity
and Annunciation under Sergius I., at the end of the
seventh century. About 847 Leo IV. ordained that it
should be celebrated with a vigil and octave in the
basilica of St Lawrence without the Walls. In the
Gothico-Gallican missal of the seventh or eighth century,
edited by Mabillon,<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> the festival is placed on the 18th
January,<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> and not on the 15th August, as is also the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
in the Lectionary of Luxeuil of the seventh century.
This circumstance points to the conclusion that, independently
of Byzantine influence, it was observed
already at an earlier date in other parts of the Church as
well, and came into existence spontaneously, so to speak.</p>

<p>It is also noteworthy that the feast appears already
with the title <i>Assumptio</i> in the canons of Bishop Sonnatius
of Rheims, composed sometime about the year 630.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
In the canons ascribed to St Boniface some amount of
vacillation is observable. By the thirty-sixth canon of
the Council of Mainz, in 813, it is appointed as a feast
for the whole Frankish Empire, while the earlier Council
of 809 had decided nothing concerning its adoption.</p>

<p>Among the Latins the festival did not at first bear
the name <i>Assumptio</i>, but was called <i>Domitio</i> or <i>Pausatio</i>,
corresponding to the Greek title. This name left the
particular object of the feast uncertain—whether it
commemorated merely the decease or the bodily
assumption of Mary into heaven. It was probably
due to this that in the ninth century doubts as to the
latter were here and there expressed.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>Unlike both Easterns and Westerns, the Copts have
placed the death and bodily resurrection of the Mother
of God on the 16th January (21st Tybi). We find it
so in the <i>Synaxarium</i> of the ninth century in Mai, and
in that of Michael of Atriba; while the older Calendar
of saints belonging to the seventh century given by
Seldenius has a “<i>Planctus Dominæ Mariæ</i>” on this day,
which may well mean the same thing.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>In not a few German and Sclavonic dioceses a blessing
of the fruits of the field takes place on the 15th August.
This is of ancient Germanic origin, but has been adopted
into the Roman ritual. It seems to have arisen from
some popular custom connected with harvest.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<h4>5. <i>Institution and Spread of the Festival of the Immaculate
Conception</i></h4>

<p>The two dogmatic definitions formulated during the
pontificate of Pius IX. had this in common that they
came as a surprise to many, although they only set at
rest questions which had been ventilated for centuries.
This is especially the case with regard to the doctrine
of the Immaculate Conception, for the discussion of the
question had been prolonged during a thousand years.
Bound up with the discussion was the contention whether
the festival in question ought or ought not to be celebrated;
and these two things, the theoretical treatment
of the doctrine, and the fortunes of the festival, were
most intimately connected with one another, and found
at one and the same moment their final solution.
Indeed, the festival has a longer history than the
doctrinal controversy. For the observation that
Church festivals required a long time from their inception—which
is for the most part to be looked for in
monasteries—until they obtained general approbation
and acceptance from the ecclesiastical authorities, applies
to many festivals; but none has had so long and
changeful a history as the festival of the Immaculate
Conception of the Mother of God. It has now, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
last fifty years, been celebrated as a festival of obligation
throughout the Catholic Church, and has even been
adopted in those countries which formerly set themselves
most strongly against the increase of ecclesiastical
holy days.</p>

<p>Our object is to give a comprehensive and detailed
history of the vicissitudes of this festival, while leaving
aside the history of the doctrine. Naturally they
cannot be kept entirely distinct, still the latter shall
only be touched upon in so far as is necessary for the
elucidation of the history of the feast.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Passaglia and
his collaborator Clemens Schrader, S.J., in their well
known work, “<i>De Immaculato Deiparæ Conceptu</i>”
(Rome, 1854 and 1855, 3 vols. 4to.), have given us a rich
and noteworthy collection of materials for this purpose.
We must do justice to the immense learning expended
upon this work both in its dogmatic and historical
sections, but the historical explanations can no longer
be regarded as satisfactory. On the one hand, subsequent
investigations have brought fresh facts to light
which give a new turn to the history; and, on the other,
Passaglia was deficient in the critical faculty, and
merely in order to marshal as many proofs as possible,
he made use of several which cannot stand close investigation,
and must be set aside if the whole question is
not to be misrepresented.</p>

<p>For the correct understanding and examination of the
sources of evidence, it must first be observed that
anciently both among the Greeks and the Latins the
term <i>conceptio</i> (σύλληψις) was taken in the active sense,
while we are accustomed to take it in the passive sense.
<i>Conceptio Mariæ Virg.</i> signified then the conception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
of Christ by Mary, while the (passive) conception of
Mary was called the <i>Conceptio S. Annæ</i>.</p>

<p>Thus it follows that the festival of “the Conception
of Mary” and the festival of “the Immaculate Conception”
are not the same thing. Originally only a
<i>festum Conceptionis B.M.V.</i> was celebrated, and only
in course of centuries has a <i>festum Immaculatæ Conceptionis</i>
been evolved therefrom. This must not be
regarded as a mere question of terms which might be
employed interchangeably. Passaglia has not sufficiently
emphasised this distinction, and consequently
his presentation of the facts creates the impression that
there was already in the fifth century a festival of the
Immaculate Conception of Mary, which is altogether
erroneous. The simple statement of the facts will
make this clear, and show that in the course of centuries
the feast originally celebrated as the Conception of the
Blessed Virgin Mary was changed into a feast of the
Immaculate Conception. This change came about in
proportion as the matter was made clearer by dogmatic
discussion, and as the doctrine of Mary’s exemption
from original sin gained adherents in the schools.
Even when this doctrine had found general acceptance in
the West, and had authoritatively received the support
both of conciliar decrees and of papal dogmatic decisions,
the ancient title of the feast still remained in use for a
long time. If we consult the service-books printed
before 1854, we find in them indeed on the 8th December
the <i>festum conceptionis</i>, but the word <i>immaculata</i> is
nowhere found in the office for the feast. An orderly
representation of the historical facts concerned will show
how this was brought about.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that the feast of our Lady’s Conception
arose in the Eastern Church, and had gained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
civil recognition in the Byzantine Empire at a time,
when in the West, ecclesiastical circles were still
debating whether or not its celebration ought to be
permitted. In a constitution entitled, “Concerning the
days of the year which are whole holidays and half
holidays,” the Emperor Manuel Comnenus in 1166
recognised it as a public festival on which servile work
was forbidden. Now it is a known fact that the civil
authorities are slow to give recognition to ecclesiastical
festivals, and accordingly festivals have often been
celebrated by the Church for a long period before they
received the recognition of the State. So it was in this
case. The Calendar of the Church of Constantinople
in which the feast of the 9th December is marked as the
“festival of the Conception of St Anne, the mother of the
Theotocos,” is a century and a half older than this
constitution. It bears the name of the Emperor Basil,
meaning the second of this name surnamed Porphyriogenitus
(976-1025), and, accordingly, it follows that even
then the festival had received some lesser degree of
recognition from the State.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>Concerning the date of the introduction of this feast,
we have detailed information in a sermon of John of
Eubœa, who lived in the middle of the eighth century.
He was first a monk and then Bishop of the island, and
was contemporary with St John Damascene, whom he
occasionally visited. John declares that there are ten
points in the life of the Holy Virgin which must be
commemorated, and these he enumerates in the tenth
section of his sermon. The most of them are at the same
time feasts of our Lord, the only ones entirely relating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
to our Lady being her Nativity, Annunciation, and
Assumption. With regard to the feast of our Lady’s
Conception, John hesitates. First of all, in the passage
referred to above, he enumerates it among the feasts,
but at the end of his sermon he states that it is not
acknowledged by all,<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> but he speaks highly in its favour,
and considers in conclusion that it ought to be celebrated.
From this it is plain that in his time the feast was not
yet generally accepted, and that he exerted himself to
spread it. If Passaglia, who quotes this sermon as
evidence for the feast, had noticed this passage, he
would have learnt that in the eighth century the festival
had not yet become generally popular in purely ecclesiastical
circles, such as among the specially devout and
the religious, and he would have avoided the mistake of
throwing back the inception of the feast to the fifth
century in reliance on an interpolated and much later
<i>Typicum S. Sabæ</i>.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> John mentions the 9th December
as the day of the feast. The contents of this sermon of
his are in other respects of no importance.</p>

<p>George of Nicomedia, who lived about a century later,
is the second Greek preacher of whom we possess a
sermon for this festival.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> It bears the title, “Concerning
the Conception of St Anne,” and was delivered upon a
festal occasion (πανήγυρις), and the day is already
distinctly called a feast (ἑορτή). George considered
it no longer necessary to merely commend the acceptance
of the feast, but regarded its adoption as a matter
of course. He reveals, however, the comparatively
late date of its institution, by saying that the day was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
not to be kept “as one only recently added to the
Calendar, but as one adopted on the best grounds, since
it naturally belonged to the course of the year and
is prescribed by the nature of things. In doing so we
become partakers of the joy it promises.”</p>

<p>As far as the East is concerned these two witnesses
are sufficient, especially as they throw light on the date
of the institution of the feast. As in other cases, so
here the origin of the feast is doubtless to be sought in
religious communities. They were the first to think of
honouring this act of redemption. It was certainly
the monks, to whom is due the development of the
Church’s psalmody, who in their canonical hours celebrated
Mary’s Conception, and appointed a special day
for this purpose, the 9th December, which was always
kept as such in the Greek menologies. In course of time
the feast issued forth from the limits of the monasteries,
and from the inner circles of the devout, and attained
publicity. Preachers glorified it. It met with a sympathetic
reception in ever widening circles, until it
gradually attained the rank, if not of a feast of obligation,
at any rate, of a simple feast of devotion, and,
finally, it obtained both ecclesiastical and civil
authorisation.</p>

<p>The Byzantine Empire comprised during the whole of
the period of which we have been speaking, Lower Italy,
Sicily, and Sardinia. In the eighth century Byzantium
was no longer able to retain its hold over the duchy of
Rome and the Exarchate of Ravenna; at a still later
date it lost Apulia, Calabria and Sicily, especially when
the Normans settled in those parts. It retained its hold
over the city of Naples longest of all; it was only in
1127 that Naples was taken by Roger II., who had
himself crowned king of the Two Sicilies in 1130.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>The constitution of Manuel Comnenus of 1166 mentioned
above was never promulgated in Naples, and had
no force there, but the connection with Byzantium had
lasted sufficiently long for the feast of Mary’s Conception
to obtain an entrance into Naples. That it actually did
make its way there is proved by the Calendar of the
Neapolitan Church of the ninth century, engraved on
marble, and showing traces of Byzantine influence, which
was discovered in 1742 in the Church of San Giovanni
Maggiore. Apart from the historical facts which we
have mentioned, the name and date of the feast—<i>Conceptio
S. Annæ</i>, and the ninth December—show a
Byzantine origin. And so in respect of the history of
this feast, Naples, along with Lower Italy and Sicily,
must be classed with the Eastern half of the Catholic
Church as celebrating a feast, of which at Rome no one
had as yet thought.</p>

<p>From all this it follows that the feast of Mary’s Conception
was known in the Byzantine Empire as early as
the beginning of the eighth century, although under a
different name from that which it now bears. Was the
feast, in its essential idea, the same as ours? This
question the reader may answer for himself. There
is much doubtless in favour of an affirmative answer.
Greek writers refer to our Lady in the highest conceivable
terms, as can be amply proved from the lections
of the office for the 8th December now in use. They
exalt her not merely above all men, but absolutely above
every creature. Moreover, the feast of the Conception
has a meaning only when the conception is regarded
as sinless, just as the Greeks celebrate a commemoration
of the conception of St John the Baptist
solely On the ground that John was sanctified in his
mother’s womb. In all other cases, it is not the birthday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
of the saints which is kept, but the day of their death.
All this tells in favour of the affirmative. But on the
other hand, the fathers of the Eastern Church have never
either used or even discovered the specific terms to
designate the Immaculate Conception, nor have they
ever proposed the question if our Lady was free from
original sin.</p>

<p>It is indeed very difficult to maintain the former view
in the face of the fact that the Greeks, at the present day,
do not regard their feast of Mary’s Conception as implying
this meaning, but among them it is a feast of little
importance. Their Breviary contains the following
notice of the feast: “God sent His angel to the pious
couple Joachim and Anna, and announced to them that
the barren would give birth, and so to prepare the way
for the conception of the Virgin. Thus the holy Virgin
Mary was conceived in consequence of an announcement,
but by means of man and from his seed. For our Lord
Jesus Christ alone was born in an ineffable manner of the
holy Virgin Mary without the co-operation of man and
his seed.”</p>

<p>This announcement by an angel is based on an
apocryphal legend, which appears in Byzantine sermons
on our Lady, belonging to the eighth and ninth centuries.
Joachim, according to Jewish custom, desired to present
an offering in the Temple, but was driven back and
insulted by members of the tribe of Reuben because he
was childless. This caused him so much pain that
instead of returning to his home, he sadly betook himself
into solitude. Anna, in her anxiety, prayed earnestly
to God, and was informed by an angel she should give
birth to a daughter richly endowed with gifts of grace.
This legend derived from the <i>Proto-evangelium</i> of James,
and propagated chiefly in the sermons of John of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Eubœa and of Peter Siculus, was also known in the
West, and figures largely in works of art; as, for example,
in the beautiful picture in the cathedral at Augsburg,
by Hans Holbein the Elder.</p>

<p>The Greek Breviary, however, shows that there was
current among the people a still stranger idea, which it
strongly opposes, <i>i.e.</i> that Mary was born on the seventh
month after her conception, and so was what is called a
seven months’ child. The reason why it is worth while
to allude here to this will be plain later on. We may
merely point out how all this shows the unimportant
character of the festival among the Greeks.</p>

<p>It was otherwise in the West.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Here the festival in
question makes its appearance on the scene just as its
development in the East came to an end. To the
tentative attempts at the introduction of this festival in
monasteries, and among the inner circles of the devout,
there followed its acceptance by several dioceses, not
however without opposition. The theoretical discussion
over the warrant and significance of the festival accompanied
the early instances of its official introduction.
These discussions lasted through centuries, and were only
brought to a conclusion in our own times.</p>

<p>In attempting to trace out its introduction in detail,
it must be borne in mind that we are treating of what
was in the first instance a festival of the Conception
only, not of the Immaculate Conception; that it was
not a public holy day of obligation, but only a religious
commemoration confined to the four walls of the
churches; and, finally, that when it was adopted by
some religious order or celebrated in some monastery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
it does not follow that it was at the same time adopted
by the diocese or country wherein such a monastery was
situated.</p>

<p>Clear and detailed evidence for its introduction comes
to us first of all from England. The individuals who
more or less exerted themselves in this connection were
a certain Elsinus or Helsinus, a monk of St Augustine’s,
Canterbury, and later Abbot of Ramsay in the diocese
of Winchester (1080-1087), St Anselm of Canterbury and
his nephew of the same name, Osbert de Clare, Prior of
Westminster, Warinus, Dean of Worcester, Abbot Hugh
of Reading, and finally, the historian Eadmer.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Further
particulars concerning these persons will be found in the
appendix.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>We begin with the history of Elsinus, or Helsinus.
He is not an imaginary personage, but one whose story
is historically true. He was monk at St Augustine’s,
and then Abbot of Ramsay under William the Conqueror.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
A legend, current in the middle ages in various forms as
either a sermon or a letter of Anselm the Elder, states
that he was sent by William with presents to the King
of Denmark, in order to discover if he contemplated an
invasion of England. Having fulfilled his embassy, he
was overtaken on his return voyage by so severe a
storm that the ship seemed about to be dashed in pieces.
As all were invoking our Blessed Lady in this moment of
peril, a form arrayed in episcopal vestments appeared,
which was supposed to be St Nicholas, the patron of
sailors. He addressed Elsinus by name, and promised
him he would be saved, if he in his turn
promised to celebrate the feast of our Lady’s Conception
annually on the 8th December, and to exhort
others to celebrate it also. Elsinus promised, and
all were saved.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>This legendary narrative was adopted formerly for
the lections in the Breviary,<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> but more recently it has
been altogether discredited. The learned Maurist
Gerberon, editor of St Anselm’s works, in particular has
objected to this narrative on the grounds that after the
battle of Hastings in 1066, William returned to Normandy,
and the landing of the Danes followed immediately.
Gerberon has overlooked the fact that since
Elsinus undertook this journey as Abbot, not as a simple
monk—which in itself would have been highly improbable—it
must be placed between 1080 and 1087, not
in 1066. However, although the story be a legend, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
this much is true, that Elsinus did introduce the feast of
the 8th December into his monastery.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>That Anselm the Younger introduced it into his
monastery at Bury St Edmonds is proved by two letters,
dating from 1128-29, of Osbert de Clare, a zealous
defender of the doctrine. He laments that two bishops,
Roger of Salisbury and Bernard of St Davids, have
opposed the introduction of the feast. They had even
held a Synod, and forbidden the feast as an absurd
novelty. This fact, and also the circumstance that Osbert
himself in a sermon on the 8th December made no
mention of the Immaculate Conception of Mary from
fear of the opponents, as he himself says, show how
strong the opposition to both feast and doctrine must
have been among the Anglo-Saxon secular clergy of that
period.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>From what has been said it can be regarded as historically
certain that the feast of Mary’s Conception was
observed in many Benedictine monasteries in England,
about the year 1128—in Ramsay, Bury St Edmonds,
Reading, Worcester and Westminster.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>Possibly also in some others, but in no case was the
feast celebrated outside the walls of the monasteries.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
It must have encountered opposition, for important
personages, both ecclesiastical and secular, looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
it with disfavour, and it was still very far from gaining
the support of the secular clergy, of bishops and synods.
Indeed one synod of the period forbade the feast
altogether. Its adoption followed only in the fourteenth
century. When we bear in mind the ecclesiastical
and civil circumstances of the times, we are
astonished to find how such a novelty—for so the feast is
called in the writings already quoted—could have made
its way to England first of all. For, in the eleventh
century, that country was torn by internal strife, and
invaded by foreign foes; while the national clergy,
according to the statement of a contemporary English
historian, were sunk in simony and worldliness.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> That
is scarcely the atmosphere suitable for the inception of a
feast so intimately connected with the inner religious
life of the community. For this some impulse from
without was required. Such an impulse came indirectly
from the East through intercourse with Normandy,
whence so many learned and zealous monks and clergy
came to England after the conquest. The political,
or rather dynastic, connection of the country with
Normandy dates not only from the battle of Hastings in
1066, but goes back to the times of King Edward the
Confessor, whose wife Emma was a Norman princess.</p>

<p>The official introduction of the feast of our Lady’s
Conception in England only commenced in the thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
century, and only spread slowly. The provincial Synod
of Oxford in 1222, Canon VIII., refused to recognise it as
a feast of obligation, although it established its private
observance. The diocesan Synod of Worcester does not
mention it in its list of festivals. On the other hand it
was celebrated at St Albans in 1228,<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> and the diocesan
Synod of Exeter in 1287 formally adopted it by a decree
which naturally affected that diocese alone.</p>

<p>In Normandy the feast, whose celebration found in
England precarious toleration in the retirement of the
cloister, was already introduced by the secular clergy
without encountering any opposition. This is stated by
Osbert himself when he remarks in his letter to Anselm
how, on the other side of the channel, the feast had been
solemnly kept by some bishops.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> If these words do not
apply to Normandy, we should like to know of some other
country on the Continent where the feast was then
observed. It is certain that it was kept at Rouen under
Bishop Rotricus (1165-1183), and placed on a level with
the feast of the Annunciation.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Owing to the law that,
in the province of Rouen, consisting of six dioceses,
the daughter churches must follow in their ritual and
Breviary the use of the metropolitan Church, this feast
would soon be celebrated all over Normandy.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
Corporation of Norman students at the Paris University
chose it as their particular festival, it was not
a mere fancy on their part, but must have had its
origin in the ecclesiastical observances of their home.
Still less must this fact have been the cause why
the feast in the middle ages went by the name
of the “Norman’s feast” (<i>festum nationis Normannicæ</i>).
This name can only have come into existence
because the feast had been zealously celebrated in
Normandy for a long time, by all the people, before
it was kept in any other country of the West. Henry
of Ghent, a member of the Sorbonne, distinctly declares
this to have been the case.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> The Normans,
however, could not have been the originators of
the feast. Doubtless they got their knowledge of it
in Lower Italy, where it had been observed for a long
time, after they had begun to settle there. Those who
are unwilling to adopt so rationalistic an explanation of
the matter, draw attention to the fact that the two
Anselms, the earliest known propagators of the
feast in England, were not uninfluenced by other
Eastern forms of showing honour to our Blessed
Lady. This is shown not only by Anselm’s hymns
on the Mother of God, in which the refrain, <i>Ave
sponsa insponsata</i>, has been adopted from the so-called
<i>hymnus acathistus</i>, but also by an entry in
an Irish Calendar (upon which too much stress has
recently been laid), in which Mary’s conception is
put down on the 3rd May, in accordance with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
ridiculous Greek legend,<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> that Mary was born seven
months after her conception. Granting that this entry
really belongs to the ninth century, it is only evidence of
monastic learning, but affords no proof for the existence
of the feast in Ireland. It only shows that the writer
knew of the Greek fable in question, and made use of it
for his Calendar.</p>

<p>It may be asked if the feast made its appearance in the
West first of all in Normandy, and in England, which
since 1066 had been politically united with Normandy, or
had been observed earlier elsewhere? Could we believe
Passaglia, it had been celebrated already in Spain in
the seventh century.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> If so, it is impossible to think it
could have disappeared later on without leaving a trace
behind. The genuine Mozarabic liturgy does not contain
it, and in the oldest Spanish Calendars, <i>e.g.</i> that of
Toledo of the tenth century, published by Morinus, it does
not appear. The Jesuit Leslæus, who wrote the introduction
to the Mozarabic liturgy, admits candidly that
the feast came into Spain through France.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The two
reasons which Passaglia gives for his opinion are worthless.
He relies upon a spurious life of St Isidore of
Seville, which contains later interpolations, while the
genuine life written by Ildefons makes no mention of it,
and upon a passage in the laws of the West Goths. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
this latter passage has to be taken as referring to the
Conception of Christ by Mary in accordance with the
terminology then in use. When the same author wishes
to make his readers believe that the feast existed in
Cremona already in the tenth century,<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> it has to be borne
in mind that Bishop Sicardus of Cremona,<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> in the
thirteenth century, strongly opposed its introduction
there.</p>

<p>It may be regarded as certain that the feast of our
Lady’s conception was introduced into the Benedictine
monasteries of England by the two Anselms at the end
of the eleventh century. We must not, however,
regard England as especially the home of the feast in the
Latin Church, for both St Anselm and his nephew had
received their training in Normandy, which was their
second home. From thence they passed in later middle
life to England, for William liked to fill the chief
spiritual posts in England with foreigners.</p>

<p>When the author of the tract <i>De Conceptione B.M.V.</i>
laments that the feast met with much opposition both
from clergy and laity, his complaints were well grounded,
for the names of a number of famous men are known
to us at the present day as having strongly opposed both
the feast and the doctrine which underlay it. For the
most part they were men of importance. We can name
Roger of St Albans, Bishop of Salisbury, and Bernard,
Bishop of St Davids († 1147). The former was minister
and adviser of King Henry II., the latter chaplain to
Queen Matilda. In France the most famous opponent
of the feast was St Bernard, the celebrated preacher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
Maurice de Sully († 1196), Bishop of Paris, and Peter of
Celle, Abbot of Moutier-la-Celle, from 1181 Bishop
of Chartres.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> It is especially remarkable that the greatest
liturgists of the middle ages, Beleth, Sicardus of Cremona,
and Durandus of Mende, all opposed the feast.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> In
Germany, the monk Potho of Prüm may be named,
although his views are obscure.</p>

<p>The conduct of St Bernard must be more closely
examined. The opportunity of expressing his views was
furnished by the circumstance that the Canons of Lyons
commenced, about 1140, to celebrate the feast of our
Lady’s conception, without having obtained the authority
of the Holy See for this “novelty.” According to the
then existing state of canon law, the bishops had the
right of arranging by themselves the festivals to be
celebrated within their respective dioceses. But St
Bernard in his letter to the Canons makes no mention
of the bishop. This is explained by the fact that the
letter was written at a time when the Church of Lyons
was without any recognised head, and when St Bernard
was exerting himself with the Pope to obtain the confirmation
of Fulco, the bishop elect.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> It may well have
been that in this matter the canons acted despotically.
St Bernard, however, does not bring this charge formally
against them in his letter, but lays all the stress upon
objections to the inner significance of the feast. It was
customary, he says,<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> to celebrate the day of our Lady’s
birth, because she, like Jeremias and John the Baptist,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
had been sanctified before birth (fuit ante sancta quam
nata). Mary could not be holy before she existed, but
her existence began at her conception and that was not
free from concupiscence. If her conception was to be
regarded as holy, one must logically hold that her
parents were already holy also. Christ our Lord was
conceived by the Holy Ghost, and consequently His
conception was holy and a feast of the Church (Annuntiatio).
Before taking any steps in the matter, St
Bernard concludes, the Apostolic See ought to have
been consulted, to whose authority he commits the
matter. The Roman Church, to which he appealed,
was, however, in no hurry. More than three hundred
years had to pass before she in any degree broke through
her reserve on this question.</p>

<p>The effect of this letter is not known, but there is no
doubt that during the twelfth century the feast made
steady progress in France. Unfortunately we possess
only a few data to illustrate its development, for the
investigation into the ecclesiastical history of special
localities requires to be more extensively taken in hand.
In Rouen, the capital of Normandy, it was certainly
observed at that period, as we have already seen. Next,
its observance is prescribed by the statutes of Le Mans,
in the Province of Tours, in 1247.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> In Rheims it appears
between 1261-1271. A more important fact is that the
General Chapter of the Franciscans, held at Pisa in 1263,
decreed that the feast should be celebrated throughout
the entire order.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Although it did not attain to the rank
of a feast of obligation for clergy and people, yet it
became known throughout the world, and especially at
the papal Court at Avignon, where Franciscan influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
was strong. Finally the standpoint of the thirteenth
century with regard to this feast is best summed up
in the words of St Thomas Aquinas, “Although the
Roman Church does not celebrate it, she allows other
Churches to do so,”<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> and in those of St Bonaventure
who justifies the keeping of a festival on the day of our
Lady’s conception.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> Accordingly the number of dioceses
and provinces within which it was celebrated was
constantly on the increase; for the fourteenth century
we have Canterbury 1328; Treves between 1338 and
1343;<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Paderborn 1343; Münster 1350;<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Utrecht 1350;
Brixen 1399, while other diocesan synods, <i>e.g.</i> Prague
in 1355, did not yet adopt it. When it is asserted that
the feast had been introduced at Liège under Bishop
Albero II. († 1145), it must be urged on the other side
that the list of feasts drawn up by the diocesan synod of
Liège in 1287 makes no mention of it.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> The synod of
Cologne of 1308 does not mention it either, although it
is contained in the Cologne Calendar of the same century.
For Mainz we have the fact that this feast is employed
for dating a decree of the year 1318.<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> In the province
of Canterbury, the feast obtained official recognition
only in 1328, <i>i.e.</i> two hundred and nineteen years after
the death of those who had first exerted themselves in
its favour.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>As far as Canon law and the liturgy are concerned,
the feast of the <i>Conceptio B.M.V.</i> remained in the
fourteenth century as incomplete as it had been in the
twelfth and thirteenth. Generally speaking, however,
each bishop had then the right of appointing the festivals
for his own diocese, but this right was always restricted
to the appointment of those festivals already recognised
and permitted by the Church universal which he desired
should be observed within his own diocese—as, for
example, whether St Mary Magdalene should be kept as a
holiday or not. But in this case it was not a question
of a feast already recognised by ecclesiastical authority,
and its opponents could always object with reason:
<i>Non est authenticum</i>.</p>

<p>Important if not decisive steps were at length taken
by ecclesiastical authorities in the fifteenth century.
In the meantime, the doctrine, which had been defined
and formulated by Duns Scotus was so widely
accepted, except among the Dominicans, and enjoyed
so much popularity among the people, who violently
took sides on the question, that it was possible for the
Council of Basel (which began by being ecumenical, but
became schismatical after its quarrel with the pope), to
state in its thirty-sixth session, on the 17th September
1439, in answer to the petition of the theological faculty
of Paris, that the doctrine that Mary by a special gift
of grace had never been subject to original sin was
“pious and agreeable to the worship of the Church, the
Catholic Faith, and the teaching of Holy Scripture.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
The Council forbade the contrary doctrine to be taught.
At the same time it renewed the decree in regard to the
feast of “her Holy conception, which was kept on the
8th December both by the Roman Church and by
others.”<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Granting that the Council was ecumenical,
all circumstances connected with the feast, with regard
to both doctrine and ritual, were now formally settled.
This decree was not without effect, as soon appeared from
the fact that in the Mainz Breviary of 1507 the lections
for the second nocturn of the feast are drawn from it. It
also certainly influenced the further spread of the feast,
as soon appeared from its being expressly authorized
and received by a provincial synod at Avignon, held
under the presidency of a papal legate in 1457.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>Although the fathers of the Council of Basel were of
opinion that the feast was celebrated by the Roman
Church on the 8th December, this was only partially
correct. The fact is that at Avignon, with the full knowledge
of the Papal Court, it had been already celebrated
without meeting with any opposition from the authorities.
So, too, in Rome it had been celebrated by
religious in the churches of their monasteries. It can
well have been that Alvarus Pelagius († 1340), as we
are informed, preached on this day in Rome; this,
however, does not prove that the diocese of Rome, or
the Papal Court, had adopted the feast at that date,
for that, it would have been necessary to include the
day in question in the Calendar and treat it as a festival
in the Missal and Breviary. And so it would appear
that it was kept as a purely ecclesiastical holy day,
and not as yet as a public official holiday with rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
from servile work. Nevertheless there were those at
Basel who maintained it was a festival of the Roman
Church.</p>

<p>The Franciscan order, as has been already said,
added our Lady’s conception to the number of the
feasts observed by themselves. They celebrated it
everywhere where they had a church of their own, and
also in Avignon and Rome during the residence of the
popes. Other orders followed their example—namely,
the Benedictines, Cistercians, Carmelites, all of which had
houses in Rome,<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> and so, since there were many churches
belonging to these orders in Rome, it might well seem
as if the Roman Church herself kept the festival, all
the more since the popes knew of it and tolerated
the practice. In Sixtus IV. (1471-1484), a Franciscan
ascended the Papal throne, and he it was who finally
took the decisive step in the direction of recognition
instead of toleration. On the 27th February 1477<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> he
published the Constitution “<i>Cum præ excelsa</i>,” in which
he granted indulgences on the feast. In particular
he granted to all those who on this day recited the office
composed by the Papal notary, Leonardo Nogaroli
of Verona, and assisted at Mass and the canonical
hours, the same indulgences which his predecessors
granted for Corpus Christi. In this way the feast was
adopted into the diocese of Rome, and made its way
into the Calendar, Breviary and Missal, but only as a
purely ecclesiastical feast. It must also be observed
that no advance was made in the doctrine concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
for the pope in his decree speaks of a <i>Conceptio immaculatæ</i>,
or, as he expresses himself in another place,
<i>prælibatæ virginis</i>, not of an <i>immaculata conceptio</i>.</p>

<p>This was not the only official act of Sixtus IV. in
favour of the feast. In 1479 he built a chapel in old
St Peter’s, which he dedicated and endowed in honour
of our Lady’s conception and in honour of the Franciscan
saints, Francis of Assisi and Anthony of Padua.
In 1483, however, he was compelled to forbid, by a
special constitution, the supporters and opponents of the
doctrine of Mary’s exemption from original sin to
call each other heretics. This proves that the strife
between the two parties had then waxed warm. Even
in Germany there were bitter contentions concerning
the point in question in Frankfurt, Marburg, Heidelberg,
and at Bern in Switzerland.</p>

<p>By the decree of Sixtus IV., in 1477, the office for
the feast was finally prescribed for the diocese of Rome
as a <i>duplex</i>, but not for other dioceses; these were
free as before to adopt it or not. Clement VIII. raised
it to a <i>duplex majus</i>. Clement IX., added an octave,
and Clement XI., by a decree of 6th December 1708,
prescribed it for the whole Church.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> It had already
been observed in Spain as a regular holy day of obligation,
for Philip IV. petitioned Innocent X. for it and
the pope had granted his request in a constitution of
10th November 1644.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> It was only in 1854 that it
became, through the zeal of Pius IX., a holy day of
obligation for the whole Catholic world.</p>

<p>The steps in regard to this feast taken by Rome
were, as we have seen, separated from one another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
by considerable periods of time. With regard to the
significance of the feast, however, in spite of the declaration
of the Council of Trent, a policy of delay and <i>laissez-faire</i>
was maintained. The feast remained a simple
<i>festum conceptionis</i>, and the idea of the <i>immaculata
conceptio</i> did not receive outward expression, except
that Paul V. permitted the recitation on all free Saturdays
of an <i>officium conceptionis B.M.V.</i>, in which the <i>invitatorium</i>
is, “Immaculatam conceptionem Mariæ virginis
celebremus.”</p>

<p>Pius IX. had a new office drawn up which he prescribed
for use on the 25th September 1863, in which
the idea contained in the <i>invitatorium</i> is expressed
beyond all doubt. Hymns expressing the same idea
were inserted, and the bull “Ineffabilis” was drawn
upon for some of the lections, while for others the
preference was given to the homilies of the later Greek
writers. The pope’s letter elevating the feast to the
rank of a holy day of obligation for all Christendom
received an enthusiastic reception everywhere. The
rank of the feast was not increased. It was only by
Leo XIII. that it was placed on an equality with the
three chief festivals of the year.</p>

<p>In tracing out the long process of development by
which this feast passed from Byzantium by Lower
Italy to Normandy and England, and from thence
throughout the entire West, our attention has been
drawn especially to the conduct of the Roman See.
Passaglia endeavours by every means to magnify the
part it played, and to date its intervention as far back
as possible. Still he is finally obliged to own that the
Roman Church was not the first to pay a special cultus
to the Mother of God as conceived without original
sin. But, he adds, she has done everything during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
the space of five hundred years<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> for the glorification
of this feast and for the spread of the doctrine which
forms its basis. It is difficult to see what is gained by
magnifying the part of the Roman See at the cost of
historical truth. Others regard with satisfaction the
fact that Rome in no way pressed matters forwards.
In a question so much debated, Rome could not have
adopted a better course than to wait until the conviction
of all Christendom, in so far as it was interested in the
question, had arrived at maturity. The Immaculate
Conception had been the dominant doctrine for a long
period, and wanted nothing but the formal approbation
of the teaching church.</p>

<h4>6. <i>The Lesser Feasts of Our Lady</i></h4>

<p>While the number of lesser feasts of our Lady according
to the existing Roman rite is very considerable,
yet only a few of them come much before the public,
and the history of the most of them affords no points
of general interest. We shall therefore confine ourselves
to the following:—</p>

<p>1. The Feast of the Name of Mary owes its origin
to the devotion of the faithful, and was first authorised
by the Apostolic See for the diocese of Cuença, in
Spain, in 1513. It was abolished by Pius V., but re-established
by Sixtus V., and finally prescribed by
Innocent XI. to be observed by the whole Church on
the Sunday after the Nativity of our Lady. This was
done in 1683, on the occasion of the deliverance of
Vienna from the Turks.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>Maria, or Miriam, is the Greek form of Miryam, a
name over the etymology of which many opinions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
were held in antiquity. Eusebius explains it to mean
“illuminatrix una vel illuminans eos, aut smyrna
maris vel stella maris.”<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> St Peter Chrysologus and
St John Damascene derive it from the Syrian <i>mar</i>
(feminine <i>martha</i>), lady, which appears also in the Roman
breviary along with the other explanation, “stella
maris.” In the Middle Ages this was the usual, and
even yet is the favourite, explanation. O. Bardenhewer
maintains that the only derivation permissible is from ‎‏מָרָא‎‏,
fat or stout, in the sense of the imposing or
stately one. Those to whom Bardenhewer’s derivation
does not commend itself will be glad to hear that Professor
Macke has had the happy thought to refer back
to the first bearer of the name, Miryam, the sister
of Moses, and to derive the names of both brother and
sister from the Egyptian. In Egyptian it would be:
<i>Meri jom</i>, which would be equivalent to Friend of
Water, or Bride of the Sea, and so approaches more
to the meaning of <i>Stella Maris</i>.</p>

<p>2. The Presentation of our Lady in the Temple<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
(Præsentatio B.M.V., 21st November). The story that
Mary at the age of three years was brought by her
parents to the temple in fulfilment of their vow, there
to be educated, appears only in apocryphal writings,<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
but it fell in so completely with the ideas of religious,
both in ancient and modern times in East and West,
that it was not long before it asserted its influence
on the cycle of our Lady’s Feasts. The commemoration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
appears officially for the first time in the constitution
of Manuel Comnenus, published in 1166, as a fully
recognised festival on which the law courts did not
sit. The date is the same as at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> The
feast was introduced into the West by a French nobleman,
Philip de Maizières, who spent some time at the Court
of Gregory XI. at Avignon in 1371 as representative of
the King of Cyprus. He represented the manner in
which the day was celebrated in the East in such a way
as to move Gregory to ordain it as one of the festivals
of the Papal Court. It soon made its way in other places
also—in Navarre in 1374, in Treves in 1381, in Metz in
1420, in Cologne and elsewhere. In Rome it was introduced
by Sixtus IV., and an office for it was added to
the Roman breviary without its recitation being imposed
(<i>inter festa ad libitum</i> and <i>pro quibusdam locis</i>).
It was only Sixtus V. who, in 1585, ordained it for the
whole Church after it had been for a time suppressed
by Pius V. The original office was altered under
Clement VIII. Although the feast at first was regarded
as unimportant, it attained in Prussia to the rank of a
feast <i>in foro</i>, and this in an unexpected way, in 1893.
It falls in Prussia on the third Wednesday in November,
and occupies a position midway between the movable
and immovable feasts.</p>

<p>3. The Visitation (<i>Visitatio B.M.V.</i>) was formerly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
included among the lesser feasts of our Lady, although
the most prominent and popular of them. At the
present day it has a higher rank (<i>duplex II. cl.</i>), and,
in certain localities, it has an octave. It used to be
kept as an entire holiday. It is not only grounded
upon Scripture, but the event it commemorates is one
of the most important related in the New Testament,
both on account of the sanctification of St John the
Baptist in his mother’s womb, and because of its being
the occasion on which the Magnificat was first uttered.
Nevertheless this feast does not exist among the Greeks,
but, on the 2nd July, they celebrate the translation of the
Holy Virgin’s garment in the church of the suburb of
Constantinople called Blachernæ, which took place under
the Emperor Leo I. in 469.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>The earliest traces of the feast are found in the
thirteenth century. They appear in different localities
at about the same date, which may be due to
the fact that the newly founded order of the Franciscans
had adopted the feast and promoted its celebration.
It appears among the Franciscans as early as 1263,
and received official recognition during the great schism
from Urban VI., and Boniface IX. in 1389. After the
schism was healed, the Council of Basel was compelled
in its forty-third session, on 1st July 1441, to issue a
decree authorising the feast, and granting indulgences to
those who assisted at divine service on the day. They
felt obliged to adopt this measure, the feast not having
been adopted within the obedience of the anti-pope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>There is nothing to show why the 2nd July was
chosen for this feast, and one must needs have recourse
to surmise. There seem to be indications that it is
connected with the date of the Annunciation on the
one hand, and, on the other, with the Nativity of St
John the Baptist, the octave of which it immediately
follows. It was regarded as probable that Mary had
chosen the time of Elizabeth’s confinement for her
visit, and had remained some time with her afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
Perhaps, however, the real reason was that the Greek
Church had already for some time kept this festival
of our Lady on the 2nd July. The feast was, moreover,
kept on different days in different countries. In Paris,
for example, it was kept on the 27th June; Archbishop
John II. of Prague, who introduced it into his province
in 1385, placed it on the 28th April. Its proper place,
if the main idea of the ecclesiastical year were carried
out, would be in Advent.</p>

<p>4. The Feast of the Holy Rosary (<i>Sollemnitas SS.
Rosarii B.M.V.</i>). Towards the end of the twelfth
century we find it had become usual to use the angelic
salutation (St Luke i. 28), along with the salutation
of Elizabeth (St Luke i. 41), as a prayer. This prayer
was authorised and imposed by many councils. We
have evidence to this effect from a synod of Paris under
Bishop Odo de Sully (1196-1208),<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> and, in the period
immediately following, from the synods of Orleans,
Durham (1217), Treves (1237), and elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
new prayer was joined to the “Our Father” in such
a way that ten “Hail Marys” were recited after one
“Our Father” fifteen times, each prayer being counted
on a string of beads. The originator of this form of
prayer, called the Rosary, is generally, but without
foundation, considered to have been St Dominic. The
custom of using a string of beads on which to count a
stated number of prayers had already been in existence
for a long time, and only became general when the
custom grew up of reciting one hundred and fifty
“Hail Marys” to correspond to the number of the
psalms. This was called the “Mary Psalter,” the
Rosary, or the “Psalter of the Laity.”<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> When this
form of prayer took shape is not exactly known, but
it has quite recently been maintained that St Dominic
did not originate it, as is often affirmed. His biographer
and other contemporaries do not ascribe the invention
of the rosary to him. It is only at the end of the
fifteenth century that a Dominican, Alanus de Rupe
(de la Roche), produced this story,<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> which unfortunately
has found its way into the breviary. A
notable improvement was made in this devotion
in the fifteenth century, by adding after the name
Jesus in each Hail Mary the mention of some event
in the lives of Jesus and Mary bearing on the work
of salvation, beginning with the message of the angel
and concluding with the descent of the Holy Ghost
and the Assumption. Among these, the five points
taken from the Passion of Christ—the so-called
“sorrowful Mysteries”—form the centre, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
the entire rosary now falls into three parts, each
complete in itself.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>By this means the devotion gained a more definite
meaning. The mere recitation of the prayers is closely
connected with meditation, and each mystery has more
or less reference to some feast of our Lord or of our Lady,
and so is brought into relation with the different liturgical
seasons. It can thus to a certain extent be connected
with the whole cycle of festivals of which indeed
it was a sort of summary.</p>

<p>In its completed form the Rosary became the favourite
devotion of all, high and low, clerical and lay, and a
special confraternity, favoured by the popes and endowed
with indulgences, was formed for its spread and
encouragement.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> The Rosary was a source of innumerable
graces not only to individual believers, but
even Christendom as a whole had recourse to its
assistance in times of general distress and danger,
especially when pressed by the Turks. Remarkable
answers to prayer, among which was numbered the
victory of Lepanto (7th October 1571), first moved
Pius V. to institute a feast in thanksgiving. Gregory
XIII. gave stability to this feast by ordering in 1573 that
in every church possessing a chapel, or at least an altar
of the Rosary, it should be celebrated as “the Feast
of the Holy Rosary” on the first Sunday in October.
Clement X. granted the feast to the whole of Spain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
without this proviso. Clement XI. extended the feast
to all Christendom in consequence of the victory gained
at Peterwardein by Prince Eugene on the 5th August
1716.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>A commemoration much beloved by the people, is
that of the Seven Dolors of Our Blessed Lady, which
cannot be regarded as a festival in the usual sense of
the term. It takes place on the Friday after Passion
Sunday. Its introduction was prepared by the ascetic
literature of the twelfth century, in which also its
roots are to be sought. The pious monk Eadmer in
his treatise “On the Excellencies of the Virgin Mary”
chapter v. (see <a href="#APPENDIX_X">App. x., page 446</a>) deals with the share<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
taken by Our Lady in the sufferings of her Son. The
writing of an unknown author (<i>De Passione Christi
et Doloribus et Planctibus Matris Ejus</i>, <span class="smcap">Migne</span>, <i>Patr.
Lat.</i>, clii.), attributed to St Bernard, while full of deep
piety, is yet rather effeminate and sentimental. The
third treatise belonging to this subject is composed
by Amadeus, a disciple of St Bernard, Abbot and afterwards
Bishop of Lausanne († 1159), whose fifth homily
is entitled <i>De Mentis Dolore et Martyrio B.M.V.</i> (<span class="smcap">Migne</span>,
<i>Patr. Lat.</i>, clxxxviii., 1325-1331). He deals with Our
Lady’s share in her Son’s sufferings in a merely general
way and in outline. At a later date, the matter was
treated in more detail and with additions, so that the
Seven Dolors of Our Lady were the result. In this
form, the matter was taken up by the Servites, whose
order came into existence in 1240, and to whom Innocent
IX. in 1688 granted a second feast of the same name
to be celebrated out of Lent on the third Sunday in
September.</p>

<h4>7. <i>The Feast of St Joseph.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The Cultus of SS. Joachim
and Anne</i></h4>

<p>During the first centuries of the Church’s existence
it was only the martyrs who, as we have said, enjoyed
religious veneration. It was probably owing to this
custom that no cultus was paid even to those personages
who had been closely related to our Lord during His
earthly life. St Joseph, our Lord’s foster-father, is a
striking instance of this law. Although mentioned as
a “just” man in Holy Scripture, and the object of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
occasional eulogies in patristic literature, he received
universal public veneration only at a late date. While
we possess much information concerning the tombs of
the Apostles, and while even the graves of the Old
Testament prophets have frequently had attention
drawn to them, tradition has nothing to report concerning
the death, burial, and relics of St Joseph.</p>

<p>The earliest traces of a direct cultus appears in one
of the Coptic calendars<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> published by Seldenius. In
this “Joseph the Carpenter” is entered on the 20th
July, as also in the somewhat later <i>Synaxarium</i> in
Mai,<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> which at latest may belong to the ninth century.
The date, 20th July, had no influence upon other
churches. The menology of Constantinople does not
contain St Joseph’s name, and even the <i>Basilianum</i>
only mentions him by the way on the 25th December,
in the form of a commemoration. After the Nativity
of our Lord, the Magi are first mentioned, and then
St Joseph as spouse and protector of the Holy Virgin
(ὁ μνήστωρ καὶ φύλαξ τῆς παρθένου). He has no special
day of his own.</p>

<p>In the West, an Antiochene martyr called Joseph,
otherwise unknown, appears in the so-called martyrology
of St Jerome on the 20th March.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> This cannot refer
to the foster-father of Christ on account of the mention
of Antioch and the absence of any indication of the
saint’s condition, although this transformation has taken
place in some martyrologies. With the unmistakeable
title of foster-father of our Lord (<i>nutritor Domini</i>),
St Joseph appears first in the martyrologies of the tenth
century, as in one belonging to Fulda<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> and in others.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
As these are of private origin, and of merely local
importance, it cannot be said that the cultus of St Joseph
had therefore become universal. Throughout the whole
Middle Ages it remained rather a private devotion,
although numerous traces of the esteem in which St
Joseph was held, and even of external veneration paid
to him by individuals are to be found.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>It was through the private devotion of many important
or holy members of the Church that the public
cultus of St Joseph came into existence. Among these
may be named St Bernard, St Gertrude, St Brigid of
Sweden, and St Vincent Ferrer. Among the most
enthusiastic and influential in this respect was the
Chancellor John Gerson, following the lead of his master
Peter d’Ailly, and, at a later date, the Abbot Trithemius.
In 1400, Gerson composed an office in honour of the
Espousals of Joseph with Mary, and urged the Council
of Constance to take steps for the spread of the devotion.
The way had been already prepared by the Franciscans,
especially St Bernardine of Siena, and Bernardine de
Bustis, who showed great zeal for the worship of St
Joseph.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>These attempts resulted in the approval given to
the cultus by Sixtus IV.,<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> who inserted St Joseph’s
day in the Roman Breviary as a feast with one lection
(<i>festum simplex</i>). Under Clement XI. it was changed
into a feast with nine lections. Accordingly, at the
end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
centuries, the 19th March began to be kept as St Joseph’s
day in the Missals and Breviaries of many religious
orders, <i>i.e.</i>, the Carmelites, Hermits of St Augustine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
Premonstratensians, Dominicans, Knights of St John;
these were followed by the Benedictines and Jesuits,
while the service-books of the Carthusians, Camaldules,
Cistercians and Cluniacs of the same period remained
without it.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the fact that later on, several royal personages
such as the Emperors Ferdinand III. and Leopold
I. of the House of Habsburg, and King Charles II. of
Spain, were devoted to the cultus of St Joseph, Gregory
XV. raised his festival to the rank of a festival of obligation
in 1621. Benedict XIII. inserted his name into
the Litany of the Saints, and Pius IX., on the 8th
December 1870, conferred upon him the office of Patron
of the Universal Church.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks, the parents of Our Lady enjoyed
a religious cultus from a comparatively early date,
although all that was known of them was derived
from the apocryphal <i>Proto-evangelium</i> of James.
Joachim and Anne already had their own commemoration
on the 9th September in the menology of Constantinople,
and Justinian I. is said to have built a church
in honour of St Anne in Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> Their names
are mentioned by Epiphanius<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> and appear in the
oldest Neapolitan Calendar on the 9th September, a
circumstance which shows Byzantine influence, for
among the Syrians their festival is kept on the
25th July.</p>

<p>In the West, however, their legend was received with
considerable reserve, and although Pope Leo III. had
their pictures placed in the church of <i>Maria ad Præsepe</i>,
no trace of any liturgical commemoration appears in
calendars before the Middle Ages. It is no proof that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
any special cultus was paid to them, that we find them
occasionally mentioned in writings and spoken of as
saints. It was only in 1378 that Urban VI. authorised
the worship of St Anne for the English at their own
request. Sixtus IV. especially approved of it,<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> and
Gregory XIII., in 1584, appointed the 26th July for
her feast. In the fifteenth century she was venerated
with special devotion in Germany, the town of Annaberg
being named after her.</p>

<p>As regards Joachim, Julius II. is said to have approved
of his being commemorated with a special office on the
22nd March. Gregory XII. introduced a new and
improved office, and fixed the commemoration for the
Sunday within the octave of the Assumption. Leo
XIII. raised it to the rank of a feast of the second
class.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>Baillet has some remarks concerning Our Lady’s
parents which are worthy of notice. He thinks that
Mary at the time of her espousals to Joseph was an
orphan; consequently, since her parents died before
the death of the Redeemer, they were considered as
belonging to the Old Testament, and were not made
the object of a cultus. Whether they were actually
named Joachim and Anne is doubtful,<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> for Anna in
Hebrew means “Grace,” and Joachim, “Preparation
of God.” It is possible that owing to ignorance of
their real names, these appellations were chosen for
them. The names appear in Epiphanius only at the
end of the fourth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<h4>8. <i>The Festivals of the Apostles in General</i></h4>

<p>The cultus of the apostles followed the same lines of
development as that of other saints. At first it was
merely local, but although the tendency to observe the
festivals of the apostles throughout the whole Church
was stronger than in the case of other saints, still their
festivals did not attain earlier to universal observance
than those of ordinary saints, that is to say, at the period
of the compilation of universal martyrologies, though
there were, of course, some exceptions.</p>

<p>The earliest calendars of particular churches have, on
the average, only a few feasts of apostles, usually only
one or two. It was only in course of time that the
longing for completeness appeared, which in the tenth
century was carried to such a pitch by the Greeks that
they set down in their calendars not merely every personage
who had received honourable mention in the
New Testament, but even the Seventy Disciples,
although there was but slender authority for their
names.</p>

<p>From the first a difference was made between the
apostles who had lived and worked within the existing
boundaries of the Roman Empire, and those who had
ended their lives in barbarian countries. In the far
East, there was a second world-power similar to
the Roman power in the West, <i>i.e.</i>, the empire of
the Parthians, or that earlier Persian Empire of the
Achæmenides, which in its turn, again, had risen from
the ruins of the ancient empires of Babylon and Assyria.
The Jews had obviously numerous relations from old
time with this Eastern Empire in consequence of their
historical connection with it. After the return from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
exile, many Jews had remained there, and probably
many others returned thither at a later time. In fine,
the circumstances attending on the first Whitsunday
show that many Jews were scattered throughout those
provinces. The Eastern Empire consisted of a number
of vassal states, which recognised a supreme sovereign,
the King of Kings, but, in other respects, remained
independent and sovereign, as for example, Armenia,
whose inhabitants were moreover closely allied by
blood with the Persians.</p>

<p>The Jews, as Semites, had naturally more sympathy
with these Easterns, once their ancient grievances
had been forgotten, than they had with the Greeks
and Romans who, at the beginning of the Christian
era, were their oppressors. This explains why some of
the apostles, some for life and others only temporarily,
betook themselves thither, and spent their lives there
in mission work and even ended their days in those
parts. This is also the reason why we have so little
reliable information concerning their life and work,
and why the days of their deaths were not celebrated
for so long a period in the West. The apostles who
devoted themselves to the Eastern Empire were probably
Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Simon Zelotes,
and Jude. Thaddeus also laboured there for a time
in Mesopotamia and Osrhoëne. No traces remain of
the labours of Matthias who is said to have preached
to the Ethiopians, and of whose life, a writer of the ninth
century, Autpert, Abbot of Monte Cassino, confesses
nothing is known.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>Several of the apostles have been commemorated from
the first in the calendars, and always on the same day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
while others, on the contrary, appear on different days
in different parts of the Church, a circumstance which
seems confusing to the historical investigator, but
which can easily be explained when one has correctly
grasped the principles which operate in liturgical matters.
With regard to those who have everywhere been commemorated
from the first on the same day, one can
usually be certain that they died as martyrs in the
Churches in question.</p>

<p>Although the only correct view is to maintain that
the commemorations of the apostles were treated in
the same way as the days devoted to the memory of the
martyrs, and that their names appeared in the calendars
on the day of their death (<i>dies natales</i>), still this is true
of only a few indeed of their commemorations in the
calendars actually in use. For the majority of the
apostles died in barbarian countries with no one on the
spot to collect information, and only much later a few
floating pieces of information concerning them were collected
from popular tradition. Another difficulty may
have arisen from the different systems of chronology in
use, and so even when the day of an apostle’s death was
set down it was probably not understood by the Greeks
and Romans, and so was forgotten. For these and other
reasons it came to pass that, later on, when the commemoration
of a certain apostle had to be fixed in the
calendar, the date of the invention or translation of
his relics was generally chosen, or finally the date was
fixed simply by chance.</p>

<p>As absolutely trustworthy, I can, therefore, regard
only the day of the death of St Peter, St Paul, and St
Andrew, perhaps also the day of the death of St Mark
and St Luke, since they ended their days in civilized
countries, at a period when the hierarchy of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
had already been established in those parts. With
regard to St John, the question is open to doubt, first,
because he did not die a martyr’s death, and secondly,
because he did not preside as bishop over a particular
congregation. Had he done so, the list of bishops for
that particular city would have been careful to inform
us of the fact.</p>

<p>Although the cultus of each apostle was originally
local, yet there are early traces that the cultus became
universal. Thus already in the fifth century a day
within the octave of St Peter and St Paul seems to have
been dedicated to the cultus of all the apostles in
common. We find in the so-called Sacramentary of
Leo I. the following prayer: <i>Omnipotens sempiterne
Deus, qui nos omnium apostolorum merita sub una
tribuisti celebritate venerari</i>, etc. The same prayer
appears also in the Gelasianum, where it is found in
<i>lib.</i> 2, No. 33.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>A mediæval liturgist, Beleth, gave expression to the
view that the separate apostles had no special festivals
in the primitive Church, but that all together were
commemorated on the 1st May,<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> and that finally only
St Philip and St James continued to be commemorated
on this day. The facts, however, as far as we have been
able to learn, do not bear out the opinion of this writer
which he inferred from the greater calendars, but the
festivals of each of the apostles came into existence one
by one, from the ninth century onwards, until they
reached their full number. The council of Erfurt in
932 raised all feasts of apostles to the rank of holy days
of obligation for Germany. Pope Boniface VIII. in
1293 made them all <i>duplicia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>Even before the meeting of the Nicene Council,
Constantine had built a church in honour of all the
apostles<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> in Constantinople, in which he was afterwards
buried.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> It was rebuilt under Justinian and re-dedicated
on the 29th June 550, the feast of St Peter and St
Paul.<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> This church had considerable influence upon
the cultus of the apostles inasmuch as under Constantius
attempts were made to provide it with their
relics, obviously with the intention of resembling Rome
as closely as possible. The relics of St Timothy were
first translated thither from Ephesus on 1st July 356,
which caused a great increase of devotion to this saint.
He had lost his life in a popular uprising in Ephesus
under Nerva on 22nd January 97, of which his successor,
Polycrates, has given us an account.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> The church
became possessed of a still greater treasure in the
following year when the relics of St Andrew and St
Luke were placed in it.</p>

<p>As we should expect from what has been said above,
there exists historical material for the feasts of only
a certain number of the apostles, while others, as, for
example, the feasts of St Matthew, St Matthias, St
Bartholomew, and St Thomas, are of no further interest
than to mark the translation of their relics.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be useful to draw attention
to the actual increase of the festivals of the apostles
in the calendars. The <i>Leoninum</i> has only two, the
29th June and the 30th November. The lectionary of
Luxeuil in the seventh century has the same number,
<i>i.e.</i>, the 22nd February and the 29th June, that of
Silos, about 650, has four (22nd February, 29th June,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
30th November, 27th December), and, in addition,
the feast of St Peter’s Chains. The calendar of St
Geneviève (between 714-731) has the same number,
omitting St Peter’s Chains. From this point the number
of feasts of the Apostles increases rapidly; the
calendar of Charlemagne of 781 has eight already,
and subsequent calendars contain ten or more.
A singular peculiarity appears in the calendar of
Polemius Silvius (see below) where we find only one
feast of apostles, the 22nd February, “Depositio SS.
Petri et Pauli.” The ancient Neapolitan calendar
brings the number up to sixteen days, giving two
commemorations to some apostles and including the
disciples Thaddeus and Barnabas.</p>

<h4>9. <i>The Festivals of the Apostles and Evangelists in
Particular</i></h4>

<h5>(1) ST PETER AND ST PAUL</h5>

<p>The 29th June, the commemoration of the martyrdom
of the two chief apostles, is the only feast of apostles
that is still observed as a public holiday. It can be
regarded under two aspects as a universal and as a
local festival. It is important as a local festival,
because, since a constant tradition maintained that
St Peter and St Paul were put to death in Rome under
Nero on the same day, it is only natural that this day
should be kept in Rome as the <i>dies natalis ss. apostolorum</i>,
in the customary manner from the first, and so
was never forgotten. But even in other localities,
apart from Roman influence and tradition, we find
efforts made in antiquity to devote a day to the commemoration
of these same two apostles. This is proved
by the fact that in the Arian martyrology in use in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
East, it had already a place, on the 28th December, after
St Stephen and the apostles St James and St John.
This is by no means an isolated phenomenon, for in the
Armenian calendar it has a corresponding place, <i>i.e.</i>, on
the 27th December, while in the Nestorian calendar it
appears on the second Friday after Epiphany.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> In
Cappadocia, or at least in Nyssa, we find the Christmas
season again considered to be the suitable time for a
collective feast of the apostles, for the commemoration
of the apostles Peter, James, John and Paul follows
the Feast of St Stephen.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Even in the upper valley of
the Rhone, it was felt necessary to observe the day of
the death of the two chief apostles, for the calendar of
Polemius Silvius, which belongs to this region, contains
the entry: <i>depositio ss. Petri et Pauli</i>, but on the 22nd
February, the day on which in other parts of Gaul the
Feast of St Peter’s Chair was celebrated. That this
calendar gives no feast of any sort on the 29th June,
shows that in his choice of the day, Polemius was quite
independent of the Roman tradition. The considerations
which weighed with him in so doing will be explained
further on.</p>

<p>In other parts of Italy, the true day of the apostle’s
death was well known, and observed, as for example, at
Milan in the time of St Ambrose.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> Among the sermons
of Maximus of Turin, belonging to the fifth century,
we find no fewer than ten<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> for this feast. The sermons
of St Augustine, among which are five for this festival,
show that in North Africa the day was kept as a holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
day; he speaks of it as a <i>dies festus</i> and a <i>sollemnitas</i>.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
Moreover St Augustine belongs to the number of those
Fathers who expressly state that although both apostles
died on the same day of the month, they died in different
years,<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> a fact which the historical and biblical science
of the day persistently overlooks, which naturally
must cause serious misgivings as to the reliability of
the principles on which its chronology is constructed.</p>

<p>Among the numerous sermons of St Peter Chrysologus
there are none for this day. As regards St Chrysostom,
while we have seven sermons of his in honour of the
apostle Paul, we have only one “on Peter and the
Prophet Elias” conjointly, in which St Peter is only
briefly mentioned in the introduction and treated as of
secondary importance. There is nothing to show that
it was preached on the 29th June.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> The fact that neither
of these saints preached on this day, is an indication of
the practice followed at Ravenna and Antioch.</p>

<p>With regard to Rome, the local tradition, which
regarded the 29th June as the day on which both apostles
were put to death, was committed to writing by the
chronographer of 354, and all later chronographers.
A western tradition, supported by many of the great
Fathers of the Church, adds further that, though both
apostles died on the same day of the month, they died
in different years. This idea appears in St Augustine,
in the <i>Leoninum</i>, Arator, Gregory of Tours, and in
three Greek writers, but scholars have so far ignored
it. It is further evident from the <i>Depositio Martyrum</i>
that the day of their death was specially chosen for
a translation of their relics which took place in 258.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
The special festivities observed in Rome are described
for us by Prudentius from what he had seen himself
when he visited the city about 405. According to him
the whole city was in commotion: the faithful visited
the tombs of the apostles and in the two churches erected
in their honour, pontifical mass was celebrated.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> This
is in complete agreement with the tradition according
to which devotion to the martyrs was closely connected
with the spot where they suffered and with the date
on which they suffered, and the chief commemoration
consisted in the offering up of the Holy Sacrifice over
their tombs. Owing to the distance which separated
the two churches of the apostles from one another,
it was most fatiguing to celebrate mass at both places,
and so in course of time the festival was divided into
two parts, and the Mass in honour of St Paul took place
on the 30th June. An examination of the earliest
Roman missals shows that in the <i>Leoninum</i> there is
a number of masses for this day, all commemorating
the two apostles together, but, in the <i>Gelasianum</i>, on
the contrary, there is only one mass for the two apostles
conjointly (<i>III. Kal. Jul. in Natali SS. Apostolorum
Petri et Pauli</i>), and, in addition, one for each of them
separately. It may be that the division of the feast was
then customary, but the 29th June continued to be called
<i>Natalis SS. Apostolorum Petri et Pauli</i>. As early as the
fifth century the feast was kept at Rome with a vigil
and octave.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p>At an early date, the 29th June, which had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
been celebrated chiefly in the West, <i>i.e.</i>, in Rome and
the surrounding districts, began to be observed as a
universal festival of the whole Church, inasmuch
as it began to be celebrated in Constantinople.
The Roman Senator Festus, who had been sent on
matters of state to the new Emperor Anastasius, in
491, moved the emperor, according to Theodorus
Lector, to celebrate this feast solemnly in Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
Although the feast may have been kept already in
Constantinople before this time, it now began to be
celebrated with greater pomp. The day must certainly
have been known in Constantinople before this date,
but can hardly have been kept as a festival.</p>

<p>After this the 29th June appears in all Calendars and
martyrologies as the commemoration of the two chief
apostles. In the West we find it first in the Calendar
of Perpetuus of Tours. The Carthaginian Calendar is
unfortunately defective, but that the day was kept
there cannot be doubted on account of the evidence
given by St Augustine’s sermons. It is also found in
the later oriental Calendars, with the exception of a
few belonging to Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>While this feast, like the festivals of all martyrs,
was originally local, and was celebrated only in Rome
and in the churches dependent upon Rome, the esteem
in which the Roman Church and the apostles were
held early gained for it the character of a universal
feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<h5>(2) THE FEAST OF ST PETER’S CHAINS</h5>

<p>The Roman breviary bases the foundation for this
feast upon the following legend. Eudocia, wife of
Theodosius II.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> since 421, was presented with a chain at
Jerusalem which was believed to have been that with
which St Peter was bound while imprisoned, as recorded
in Acts, chap. xii. She brought this chain to Rome,
where another chain was already preserved in the
Church of St Peter on the Esquiline.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> This is said to
have been the chain with which St Peter was confined
during his Roman imprisonment. Both chains appeared
to be of the same workmanship, and united
themselves together of their own accord. Whereupon
the church was rebuilt at the Empress’s expense, and
received the name of <i>Eudoxiæ ad Vincula</i>. There is
no trustworthy proof for the presentation of the second
chain by Eudocia, although there is evidence that in
Rome the faithful prided themselves on possessing
a chain of St Peter before this supposed gift of the
Empress.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> Under Benedict XIV. it was proposed to
suppress the lections in the breviary containing these
legends.</p>

<p>The feast of St Peter’s chain is not in the <i>Gelasianum</i>,
and appears only in Calendars of the eighth century,
as, for example, in that of Bede, but not yet as a feast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
of obligation. The decree of the Emperor Manuel
Comnenus raised it to this rank in 1166. The spread
of the feast was undoubtedly facilitated by the circumstance
that in 969 a courtier of the Emperor Otho I.
was healed in Rome by touching the chain.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> That
the commemoration was fixed for the 1st August does
not imply that this was the day on which the apostle
was set free from imprisonment; but in this, as in other
cases, the date of the Church’s dedication caused this
day to be chosen.</p>

<h5>(3) THE CONVERSION OF ST PAUL</h5>

<p>The Conversion of St Paul was kept as a holiday
of obligation in several dioceses of France and Germany,
and especially in England. It is uncertain where and
when it first became so. It is not in the <i>Gelasianum</i>
nor in the older editions of the <i>Gregorianum</i>, but appears
in the later texts of more recent editions, as a later
addition, for it is still frequently lacking in later MSS.
and Calendars.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Nevertheless it appears in Ado and
Usuardus. The 25th January seems originally to have
had another signification; for in the recent critical
edition of the <i>Hieronymianum</i> of De Rossi and Duchesne,
the two oldest recensions give on this day a translation
of the relics of St Paul, which is said to have taken place
in Rome (<i>Romæ</i>, <i>Translatio B. Pauli Apostoli</i>). The
most recent of the ancient codices, that of Metz, now
in Bern, belonging to the tenth century, has a translation
and conversion of St Paul on the 25th January.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
The idea of the conversion soon replaced that of the
translation, and fixed the character of the feast. As
such it spread, and soon attained to universal acceptance.
The translation which the feast originally commemorated
is believed by De Waal to have taken place in the
time of Constantine, when the basilica of St Paul was
erected<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> (<i>Translatio et Conversio S. Pauli in Damaso</i>,
the words <i>conversio</i> and <i>in Damaso</i> being added by a
later hand).</p>

<h5>(4) ST ANDREW AND ST LUKE THE EVANGELIST</h5>

<p>We can deal with the festivals of these two saints
together, for in the year 357, on the 3rd March, their
relics were solemnly translated at the same time to
the Church of the Apostles in Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> Until
this date the tomb of St Andrew was in Patras, where he
had suffered death. The previous burial place of St
Luke is not specified, but it may have been either in
Patras or somewhere in the neighbourhood. The possession
of St Andrew’s relics was of great importance
to Constantinople, because he was regarded as the
apostolic founder of the Christian community there,
and the catalogue of bishops, which, historically speaking,
only begins with Metrophanes (315-325), has been
carried back to him, inasmuch as it was maintained
he had ordained Stachys as first bishop of the See.
More certain, from an historical point of view, is his
martyrdom at Patras, of which we have a trustworthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
account.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Besides this, there is a well-known encyclical
letter to the priests and deacons of Achaia, which in all
essential points agrees with the account of the martyrdom,
although in some other respects it is open to criticism.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>
The so-called martyrology of Jerome on 5th
February commemorates St Andrew’s ordination as
Bishop of Patras.</p>

<p>The date for St Luke’s death never varied and
seems to be correct. Both dates, the 18th October and
the 30th November, appear in the oldest Neapolitan
Calendar, which contains no other festival of an apostle
except St James the Less (27th December). From the
fact that the relics of St Andrew and St Luke happened
to be translated at the same time, many ancient and
modern writers drew the hasty conclusion that St Luke
had also died in Patras and been buried there. A
document which, though certainly late, can yet be
traced back to Philostorgius,<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> gives the true place of
his death and burial as Thebes, which Paulinus of
Nola confirms. His relics may well have been translated
thence at the same time as those of St Andrew were
brought from Patras. They were carried to Constantinople
at the command of the Emperor Constantius by
the official Artemius, who had also brought the relics
of St Timothy to the capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<h5>(5) ST JAMES THE GREAT</h5>

<p>James, the son of Zebedee and brother of St John
the Evangelist, was a native of Galilee. His labours,
after the Crucifixion, were not of long duration, for in
the year 42 or 43 he was beheaded at the instigation
of King Herod Agrippa I., who had enjoyed indeed
the dignity of king of Judea since 37, but only
during the last years of his reign did his power extend
over Jerusalem. According to the usual custom he
came to Jerusalem for the Passover, and then, in order
to gain favour with the Jews, he had St James seized
and made away with shortly before the feast; and when
he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to take up
Peter also, in order to make away with him too, after
the feast. This happened not long before the death
of Herod himself, which is narrated in the same chapter
of the Acts (Acts xii. 1-4 and 23).</p>

<p>The day of St James’s death was shortly before Easter,
or, as we should say, in Holy Week, and, in accordance
with this circumstance, the Copts keep his commemoration
on the 12th April,<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> and the Syrian lectionary of
Antioch on the 30th of the same month. Although
these do not exactly represent the actual day of his
death, they are not far off from it. The observance
of the actual day was, moreover, interfered with by the
circumstance that it came at a season when the thought
of our Lord’s passion prevented the celebration of a
martyr’s feast. In the menologies he is mentioned only
in the <i>Basilianum</i> on the 9th October.</p>

<p>The bodily remains of St James, as well as those
of St James the Less, were still in Jerusalem in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
sixth century.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> In the ninth century we find them
in Spain, at Compostela, where they were an object
of great veneration, as we learn from Notker Balbulus.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
They must have been taken there some time between
the seventh and ninth centuries. An account of the
translation, such as we possess in other instances,
is not extant; there is no information in any author
to show when or by whom the translation was carried
out. The translation itself can well be historically
true, although the opinion that St James preached the
gospel in Spain is only a legend.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> One is led to think
that the relics were secretly carried off by Christians
from Jerusalem from fear of the Arabs, and finally
found a second resting-place in Spain.</p>

<p>The Roman breviary and martyrology place his
feast on the 25th July, which is marked as the day
of a translation of his relics, without giving any further
particulars. The <i>Gelasianum</i> does not mention St
James, and he appears in liturgical books only at the
end of the eighth century. His name is entirely absent
from the older liturgical books of the ancient Spanish
Church, an inexplicable circumstance had he been the
apostle of Spain. The veneration for him begins to
show itself in Spain only from the ninth century. In
Western Calendars he appears in that ascribed to Charlemagne
of 781, published by Piper, and also in the later
MSS. of the <i>Gregorianum</i>, but not in the sacramentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
of Mainz dating from 840. The entries in the different
recensions of the <i>Hieronymianum</i> are noteworthy. The
Weissenburg codex on the 25th July has simply a
martyr James, with no other specification except
<i>Portus Romanus</i> as an indication of place; the Echternach
codex describes this martyr as <i>apostolus</i> and
<i>frater Joannis Evang.</i>,<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> and adds <i>Hierosolym</i>; the
codex of Bern has briefly <i>Passio S. Jacobi</i>. It is not
evident on what grounds the two later recensions have
made James, the martyr of <i>Portus Romanus</i>, into the
apostle. The <i>Neapolitanum</i> does not mention an
apostle James on the 25th July, although it does on
the 15th November,<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> and, along with Philip, on 1st
May. Although he is found in Bede, he is absent from
the Calendar of St Geneviève, dating from 731-741.</p>

<h5>(6) ST PHILIP AND ST JAMES THE LESS</h5>

<p>It is well known that in early days lists were drawn
up containing the names of those bishops at least
who had presided over the chief sees, along with the
duration of their episcopates. Since some apostles had
acted as bishop in certain cities for a length of time,
while others—as, for example, St Paul—never settled
down for long in one place, the former, in addition
to their martyrdom, had a yet further claim to be commemorated.
This is the case with St Peter, St James
the Less, and St Mark.</p>

<p>St James the Less, son of Alpheus or Clopas, immediately
after Christ’s death was entrusted with the office
of Bishop of Jerusalem by the other apostles, which he
held for thirty years.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> His death was caused by the
High Priest Ananias II., who availed himself of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
interregnum that intervened between the death of
Porcius Festus and the arrival of the new procurator
Albinus. Gessius Florus succeeded Albinus in A.D. 64.
St James’s death, according to St Jerome’s precise
statement, fell in the seventh year of Nero. According
to St Jerome’s way of reckoning, which agrees with
the official method, Nero reigned fourteen years and
a half, and his seventh year corresponds with the
sixtieth of the Christian era.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>St James was commemorated in the East on the 27th
December. This is his date in the Arian martyrology,
which is followed by the very ancient Carthaginian
Calendar. Although the latter incorrectly adds that
he was killed by Herod, it is evident that St James
the Less is intended, for all the Eastern documentary
sources place the commemoration of St James the Less
in the Christmas season. They differ as to the day,
some commemorating him on the 26th, some on the
28th, the Neapolitan and Mozarabic Calendars on the
29th, and the Syrian lectionary has his name both on
the 28th December and on the 23rd October.</p>

<p>In accordance with these ancient witnesses we would
willingly place his death on the 27th December, but
there are strong reasons against this. First, in these
documents he is coupled for the most part with St
John the Evangelist, and it is unlikely that both of them
died on the same day. Secondly, in the most ancient
document of all, the Arian martyrology, immediately
after St James and St John, on the 28th December,
come St Peter and St Paul, who suffered death on a
different date altogether; the compiler simply placed
the chief personages connected with our Lord on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
days after Christmas. Thirdly, the church built by
Helena on the Mount of Olives, in which St James and
St John received special veneration, was dedicated on
the 27th December.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Here again, as in so many other
cases, the date of the church’s consecration became the
date of the festival of the saint specially connected
with it. Of course it may be thought that the church
was consecrated on the day of the saint’s death, but
for this there is, at any rate, no proof concerning this
particular church. And so we must give up the 27th
December as the real day of St James’s death. It
may have been the day of his appointment to the
episcopate.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>That this is so is further confirmed by the accounts
written by pilgrims, in which it is stated that St James
was buried in the church on the Mount of Olives, and
that he had owned a house in Jerusalem and a burial
place, in which he had buried Zachary and Simeon.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>
It is true that later Latin authorities expressly give
his <i>dies natalis</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the actual day of his death, on the
27th December,<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> but their evidence is not conclusive.
In marked distinction from the Eastern tradition,
the <i>Hieronymianum</i> gives his death on the 25th March:
“Hierosolyma passio Jacobi Justi,” or, as in the Bern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
codex, “fratris Domini.” This date coincides strikingly
with the statement of Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, 2, 23,
11), that the death of St James happened during the
season of Easter.</p>

<p>The Constantinopolitan authorities, like the Roman,
take an independent line. The most ancient among
the former do not mention St James the Less, but the
<i>Basilianum</i> names him on the 23rd October and the
30th April, both times with the title then only given
to martyrs (ἄθλησις). We shall have occasion to
refer elsewhere to the arbitrary and singular character
of this work.</p>

<p>With regard to the Roman service-books and those
derived from them, they agree, beginning with the
<i>Gelasianum</i>, in placing St James along with St Philip
on the 1st May. This is owing to the fact that in
the sixth century a church was erected in honour of
these two apostles in Rome, which is known at the
present day as the Basilica of the Apostles. Pope
Pelagius I. (556-561) commenced the erection of the
church, which was completed by his successor John III.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
It was dedicated on the 1st May, and so it came to pass
that the commemoration of these two apostles is celebrated
in the Roman rite on this day. Later on, the 1st
May came incorrectly to be considered their <i>dies natalis</i>.</p>

<p>The commemoration of St Philip in the menology
of Basil, and in the <i>Neapolitanum</i>, is on the 14th
November. A monastery of St Philip existed in Constantinople
as early as 511.</p>

<h5>(7) ST JOHN</h5>

<p>As regards St John the Apostle and Evangelist, we
have seen his commemoration was joined with that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
St James the Less, on the 27th December, although
this was not the date of their deaths. In course of
time St John gradually eclipsed St James and gained
possession of this day for himself alone; yet in
the <i>Hieronymianum</i> and in the Gothico-Gallic missal,
ascribed by Mabillon to the eighth century, St John
and St James are still commemorated together (<i>Natalis
Jacobi et Joannis</i>). In the <i>Gelasianum</i>, and also in
later Roman and Frankish martyrologies, and in Bede,
St John alone is commemorated, as at the present day.</p>

<p>St John died and was buried in Ephesus. When
his grave was opened, probably under Constantine,
who built a church in his honour in the part of Constantinople
called Hebdomon, no remains of his body
were found in it, but only powder, which was called
manna. The intention evidently was to provide this
church in Constantinople with relics of its titular saint.
It is not surprising that the idea became prevalent
among the Greeks that St John, like our Blessed Lady,
had been taken up bodily into heaven. This opening
of his grave must have taken place on the 8th May,
for the menology of Constantinople makes mention
on this day of the manna mentioned above.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> The 26th
September seems to have been regarded as the day of
his death, for the same authority mentions the “Departure”
of the apostle (μετάστασις τοῦ ἁγίου Ιοάννου
τοῦ θεολόγου)<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> on this date. So, too, does the Calendar
of Naples under the name of his Assumption (<i>Adsumptio
Joannis Evangelistæ</i>). Among the Jacobites of Antioch
also the 26th September was kept as the day of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
departure (<i>decessus Joannis Evang. ex mundo</i>).<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> Where
there is so much divergence, nothing certain can be
determined. Most probably Morcelli is correct in
supposing that the 26th September was the day on
which St John died in Ephesus, and that on the 27th
December some church or chapel, or, at least, an altar,
was dedicated to his honour.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>The 6th May appears already as a festival of St John
the Evangelist in the Gothico-Gallic missal, without
any further specification, but simply with the rubric:
<i>Missa S. Joannis Apostoli et Evangelistæ</i>. The Roman
festival on this day, “Joannis ante Portam Latinam,”
was introduced on the ground of Tertullian’s statement.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
The oldest recensions of the <i>Hieronymianum</i> do not
mention it, nor yet the recension of Metz belonging to
the ninth century.</p>

<h5>(8) ST SIMON AND ST JUDE (THADDEUS)</h5>

<p>The apostles Simon and Jude, like St Philip and St
James, are constantly commemorated together in
Western Calendars, but in their case there is an inner
reason for this arrangement. According to a tradition,
which appears in the pseudo-Abdias, the two apostles
spent thirteen years together in Persia labouring for
the spread of Christianity, and there suffered death
at the same time in the city of Suanir.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> The day of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
their death is here given as the 1st July, which is also
given in some Western martyrologies—such as those
of Naples and Toledo, which plainly derive their information
from this source.</p>

<p>In the Roman Calendar, and in those dependent
upon them, the two apostles are indeed constantly
commemorated together, but on the 28th October. No
reason has been discovered for the choice of this date.
It does not seem to have been due either to the <i>Hieronymianum</i>
or to Bede. The former has “In Suana, a
city of Persia, the birthday of the apostles Simon and
Jude”<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> (<i>Cod. Epternac.</i>). As far as Roman sacramentaries
are concerned, St Simon and St Jude appear
only in the later recensions of the <i>Gregorianum</i>.</p>

<p>The menology of Constantinople does not contain
St Simon, but it has Thaddeus on the 20th August.
The <i>Basilianum</i> has an apostle Simon on the 29th
April who is called Jude, and on the 10th May the
apostle Simon Zelotes, and, further, an apostle Jude
on the 22nd May and 19th June. All this is obscure
and arbitrary. The fact that these apostles are not
joined together, but have each their separate day,
agrees with the Eastern service-books. The lectionary
of the Syrians of the eleventh century has St Simon
on the 10th May, Jude on the 16th May. The Coptic
Calendar in Seldenius has Jude Thaddeus on the 20th
May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>A remarkable proof of the obscurity hanging over the
apostles is found in the circumstance that in some
calendars which commemorate them together on the
same day other saints of the same name are found
in addition. Thus in the <i>Neapolitanum</i> there is a
Jude on the 26th May and a “passio S. Simonis Ap.”
on the 10th September, as well as the commemoration
of them both together on the 1st July. In the Parisian
lectionary of St Geneviève, in the Calendar of Charlemagne,
and in the <i>Gelasianum</i>, there is no mention of
St Simon and St Jude.</p>

<h5>(9) ST MARK THE EVANGELIST</h5>

<p>According to a constant and universal tradition, he
was the first Bishop of Alexandria, and his name appears
first in all lists of the bishops of that See. However, as
far as calendars and martyrologies go, his name does
not appear in those of the West until the ninth century,
nor in the <i>Constantinopolitanum</i> until the same period.
Unfortunately the most ancient Coptic Calendar in
Mai is imperfect for the month of April. It is only
in the <i>Synaxarium</i> of the ninth century, published by
Mai, that he appears. His name appears in all later
Coptic Calendars, in the <i>Neapolitanum</i>, which mentions
him a second time on the 17th May, and in the <i>Basilianum</i>.
There is not much to be said in support of the
25th April as the day of St Mark’s death. Moreover,
the <i>Hieronymianum</i> gives the 23rd September as the
date of his death, but the Paschal Chronicle puts it down
on the 1st Phormathi, <i>i.e.</i> the 26th March.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> St Jerome
in his chronicle gives the year of his death as the
eighth of Nero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>That the processional litanies take place on St Mark’s
day is a mere accident, as is proved by the circumstance
that in the oldest Latin Calendars—as, for example,
in that of Fronteau, and in the Mainz edition of the
<i>Gregorianum</i>—the <i>Litania major</i> alone is put down on
the 25th April without any mention of St Mark.</p>

<h5>(10) THE FEASTS OF ST PETER’S CHAIR<br>
(<i>18th January and 22nd February</i>)</h5>

<p>The historical investigation of these two feasts
necessitates the consideration of two questions which
must be discussed separately—first, their name and
significance, and, secondly, the dates on which they are
celebrated.</p>

<p><i>Cathedra</i>, when used in its literal sense by the oldest
ecclesiastical writers, means the bishop’s seat in the
apse of the church behind the altar, upon which he
sat, when not otherwise engaged, during the performance
of divine service. Figuratively, the <i>cathedra</i> is the
symbol of episcopal authority in general and of the
bishop’s teaching authority in particular, just as
the throne is the symbol of royal authority. <i>Cathedra
Petri</i>, then, signifies especially the teaching authority
of St Peter and his successors in the See of Rome, or,
in other words, the Primacy. This can easily be proved
from the writings of the Fathers, and the evidence for
it has often been set forth in writings and treatises
dealing specially with this question, and so it need not
be repeated here.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> That the feast was intended to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
celebrate the bestowal of the Primacy on St Peter is
clear from the oldest liturgies, and will become sufficiently
evident in the course of our remarks.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p>But how came it to pass that the Feast of St Peter’s
Chair—we are considering at present only the more
ancient of the two commemorations—was fixed for
the 22nd February? This question can only be answered
by a critical investigation into the history of the feast.
The two feasts present entirely different peculiarities.
The second half of February among the heathen Romans
was marked by popular festivities partly religious and
partly secular in character; on the 13th February
commenced the great festival of the dead, <i>Parentalia</i>,
and lasted eight days, the concluding day being called
<i>Feralia</i>. During this time no marriages were celebrated,
the temples remained closed, and the magistrates laid
aside the external insignia of their office. Upon the
commemoration of the departed followed immediately,
on the 22nd February, the festival of surviving relatives—the
<i>Chari</i>—named in consequence <i>Charistia</i> or <i>Cara
Cognatio</i>. This celebration had no recognised place
among the functions of the official worship of the
State, and no public festivities presided over by the
colleges of priests were provided for it.<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Nevertheless,
it was a very popular feast, and stuck its roots deeper
into the life of the people than any of the official
festivals. All ranks joined in celebrating it; the
portraits of the ancestors of each family were adorned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
with garlands, a sacrificial meal was presented to the
household gods, incense was burnt, and a pig was offered
in sacrifice; where quarrels had broken out in a family,
harmony was again restored, and the religious ceremonies
were performed amid the rejoicings of all; the
deeds of famous members of the family were recited,
and the day concluded with a banquet, which lasted
until a late hour.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> In addition to this, the <i>Charistia</i>
was also a festival in the schools; the walls were
hung with garlands, and presents were given to the
teachers.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></p>

<p>Such a festival must have been highly popular. It
seems to have been observed everywhere wherever
Latin was spoken, in Africa as well as in Gaul. In
Gaul the feasting customary on this occasion continued
to take place long after it had been given up elsewhere.</p>

<p>These banquets are censured in two sermons, attributed
to St Augustine, but not by him, though they are
ancient, and date from about the sixth century. From
these we see that the <i>Feralia</i> and the <i>Charistia</i> are no
longer separate; the preacher speaks only of the meals
and gifts which were offered on behalf of the departed.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
These continued on into Christian times, and in Gaul
took place on the 22nd February, although this was
not the correct day for the <i>Feralia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> It seems, then, that
in many places the memory of both living and dead
relatives was celebrated on one and the same day,
and this was always the 22nd February. About 1198<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
an Englishman, who lived in the North of France, informed
Beleth<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> of the feastings which took place on this
day.</p>

<p>Accordingly it cannot be mere accident, when we
find a Christian feast very early fixed for this day.
Gregory the Great recognised that people must not be
all at once deprived of the old customs; he ordered that
in England, at the dedication of churches and on the
feasts of the martyrs, the newly converted Christians
might retain some of the heathen customs which had
been usual on similar occasions.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Instances in which
this principle was put into practice are, for example,
the processional litanies and the customs observed at
the New Year. It is clear that the appointment of a
Christian feast on the <i>Charistia</i> is another instance of
the tendency to deprive the heathen festivals of their
harmful character.</p>

<p>That this held good of the feast in question, and that a
determined attempt was made to give it a Christian character,
is shown by the fact that in other countries a different
feast was appointed for this day. Polemius Silvius, Bishop
of Sion, in the upper valley of the Rhone, composed
a calendar for the year 448, the most ancient Christian
calendar in existence, which he dedicated to Bishop
Eucherius of Lyons.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> In this document the heathen
festivals are omitted, everything especially heathen has
been removed, and only historical and meteorological
notices remain; it contains some saints’ days, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
very few in number. On the 22nd February we find
the entry, <i>Depositio SS. Petri et Pauli</i>, along with a note
on the <i>Charistia</i>, which shows that the intention of the
writer was to supplant the heathen feast of the <i>Cara
Cognatio</i>. Again, it is noteworthy that an event was
chosen for this purpose which was commemorated in
Rome, <i>i.e.</i> the burial of the two chief apostles. The
29th June was not then kept as a festival of the apostles
in the upper valley of the Rhone, which belonged at
that time to Gaul, and probably was not kept either in
the whole province to which Sion (<i>Sedunum</i>) belonged.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>The idea of Polemius Silvius in making the 22nd
February into a commemoration of St Peter and St
Paul found no imitators, but the custom of celebrating
instead the <i>Cathedra Petri</i> on this day became general
in the Gallican liturgies. The significance of this feast is
expressed in the words of the collect for the day:
“God who on this day hast given Blessed Peter to be
head after Thee to the Church” (<i>Deus qui hodierna
die B. Petrum post te dedisti caput ecclesiæ</i>); <i>i.e.</i> the
occasion of the feast was not the foundation or organisation
of one particular church, either Rome or Antioch,
but the appointment of St Peter to be head of the
whole Church in general, or, in other words, the bestowal
of the Primacy upon him, or his ordination as bishop
(<i>natale episcopatus</i>), as others prefer to have it.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> In
this connection it must be borne in mind that, in
antiquity, it was already the custom to celebrate the
anniversary of the bishop’s consecration, and that
special masses exist in the old sacramentaries, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
among the sermons of St Leo the Great there are some
for such occasions.</p>

<p>From the fourth to the ninth century, we find this
feast of the 22nd February (Cathedra Petri), without
further specification, in the greater number of calendars
and martyrologies, especially in those of Gaul. As the
latest which give only one feast of this name, we may
mention the martyrology of Wandlebert, the Calendar
of Corbie of 826 in d’Achery,<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> and also the Gothic
Calendar. Nevertheless, there are some Frankish
calendars which contain no feast of this name, as, for
example, that of St Geneviève, published by Fronteau,
and the Calendar of Charlemagne. It is not in the
<i>Neapolitanum</i>, nor in certain lectionaries of the same
period, such as the <i>Comes Albini</i>, the lectionary of Spires,
and, finally, the Roman sacramentaries.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> It is remarkable
that neither the <i>Gelasianum</i> nor the <i>Gregorianum</i>
have a feast of St Peter’s Chair, yet it is certain that the
feast was known in Rome in the fourth century, for the
chronographer, referred to on page 295<i>n.</i>, in his <i>Depositio
Martyrum</i> sets down: “VIII. Kal. Martias, Natale
Petri de Cathedra.”</p>

<p>A remarkable alteration now took place, doubtless
caused by another view being taken of the
meaning of the feast. When the words <i>Cathedra
Petri</i> were no longer taken as referring to the bestowal
of the Primacy or the episcopal and teaching office in
general, but as referring to some definite episcopal
See, then the question was asked, Is Antioch meant
or Rome? For although the official lists reckon Evodius,
and not St Peter, as first bishop of Antioch, still there
were writers of antiquity, such as Origen, who represent
St Peter’s residence in Antioch (Gal. ii. 11) as his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
Antiochene episcopate. This view led to the division
of the feast into a Roman and an Antiochene Feast of
St Peter’s Chair; for reasons which are unknown, the
18th January was chosen for the former, while the latter
continued to be celebrated on the 22nd February.</p>

<p>The martyrology of the Venerable Bede marks the
date at which this division of the feast came into existence.
In the original recension, given by the Bollandists,
the feast of the 18th January does not appear, but
the feast of the 22nd February has the note attached,
“At Antioch.” It is possible that Bede considered
the feast commemorated the commencement of a
particular episcopate, and since, according to his
idea, the Antiochene episcopate of St Peter preceded
his Roman, and Antioch must have been the first
See occupied by the apostle, he added the words,
“At Antioch, where the disciples were first named
Christians.”</p>

<p>The separation is complete in Ado and Usuardus, and
appears in the oldest editions of the <i>Hieronymianum</i>,
and, in defect of further information, the compiler
of this document may be regarded as the originator
of the separation.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> There thus arose a threefold practice—either
both feasts were kept, or neither, or that of
the 22nd February; the last was the case in only a
few dioceses. The Cologne Calendar of the fourteenth
century had only one feast, but the more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
ancient calendar belonging to the ninth century had
both.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p>This diversity of usage, resulting from the independence
of each diocese in the adoption of festivals, was put an
end to by Pope Paul IV. at the advice of Cardinal Sirleto,
when, on the 6th January 1558, he ordered that both
feasts should be observed throughout the entire Catholic
world.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> At the consultations concerning the reform
of the Breviary in 1742, it was considered that the
two feasts should once more be joined into one, but this,
however, was not done, which,<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> from a historical point
of view, is to be regretted, for neither Eusebius nor the
official lists of bishops know anything of an Antiochene
episcopate of St Peter. The pseudo-Clementines make
use of St Peter’s activity in the See of Antioch for their
own ends,<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> and to them must be traced back the statements
of Origen, Jerome, and others, for in antiquity,
as well as in the Middle Ages, they enjoyed more consideration,
and were more widely read, than at the
present day. In the ninth century it was regarded as
an inviolable principle of canon law—as we know from
the case of Pope Formosus—that a bishop must not be
translated from one See to another. How could this
principle have been maintained in the face of so striking
an instance of translation?</p>

<p>The Feast of St Peter’s Chair was unknown to the
Greeks and Easterns in antiquity, but the modern
Uniats have naturally adopted it.</p>

<h4>10. <i>The Festivals of St Mary Magdalen, St Cecilia, and St Catherine</i><br>
(<i>22nd July, 22nd and 25th November</i>)</h4>

<p>The saints which have occupied us until now were all
prominent figures throughout Christendom, and stood
in close relation to the Redeemer and His work; in
consequence, their festivals were kept as feasts of obligation
in the Middle Ages, at a period when it seemed
almost impossible to do too much towards the development
of the cycle of feasts; a large number kept this
rank until recent times. Other saints of less importance
enjoyed the same distinction through their being the
patrons of particular countries, dioceses, or localities;
it would take too long to deal with such here; besides,
their festivals are not of historical importance. Still,
among festivals of this sort there are some which formerly
were kept as feasts of obligation; of these several
are deserving of notice, since they attained a rank
above that of a mere local festival, either because of
some special circumstance, or because the life of the
particular saint in some way or other caught the popular
fancy.</p>

<h5>(1) ST MARY MAGDALEN</h5>

<p>This is especially the case with regard to St Mary
Magdalen, whose feast, not indeed in Rome, but
throughout the South of France, and even elsewhere,
as in Cologne, was kept as a feast of obligation in the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>According to the general opinion, Mary, the sinner of
Magdala, who took her name from that place, either
because she was born there, or because it was the scene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
of her excesses, was the sister of Lazarus and Martha
of Bethania; she was the same person who humbly
bathed the feet of our Blessed Lord with her tears and
anointed them with ointment. According to another
opinion, prevalent in the Greek Church, there were three
Marys connected with our Lord—Mary, the sister of
Lazarus; Mary of Magdala, on the Lake of Gennesaret;
and the sometime sinner mentioned in St Luke vii. 37.
This latter opinion distinguishes Mary Magdalen from
Mary, the sister of Lazarus. The Latin tradition, on
the other hand, from Tertullian downwards, regards them
as identical; the sister of Lazarus having lived a life
of sin at Magdala, came, after her repentance, to live
with her brother and sister at Bethania, but was still
popularly known as Mary Magdalen. She was also
the same person, mentioned by the other two synoptists
(St Mark xvi. 9; St Luke viii. 2), who was possessed
by seven devils.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Both opinions received support from
the words of the gospels; but the Roman liturgy
has adopted the latter, and even the lections drawn up
for St Martha’s Feast are influenced by it. This office
of St Martha is only of late introduction in the Liturgy.</p>

<p>In addition, we must take into account the adventures
of the Magdalen and her family after our Lord’s death, or
rather the adventures ascribed to her. Our information
is scanty; the pseudo-Clementines state that Lazarus
followed St Peter in his missionary journeys in Syria;<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
other documents mention Cyprus as the scene of his
labours and death. Absolutely no information concerning
the further doings of his sisters has come
down to us from antiquity; however, Western<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
mediæval documents dating from the thirteenth
century are remarkably rich in details; in these
it is admitted, indeed, that he was Bishop of
Cyprus, although this would have been incompatible
with the actions here ascribed to him. This information
is contained in a voluminous work which has been
audaciously ascribed to Rabanus Maurus, Abbot of
Fulda, although it is difficult to see how he, in his retired
monastery, surrounded by forests, could have gained
possession of such information.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> The greater part of
this work, chapters i.-xxxv., is devoted to a description
of the life of St Mary Magdalen and her family, which
follows and elaborates the biblical narrative; but it
contains several additions to the facts mentioned in the
New Testament; especially there is a great deal said about
Marcella, as the housekeeper of the family at Bethania
is said to have been called, who later on played an
important part in the legend. The second part begins
with the thirteenth year after Christ’s Ascension,
when St James the Great had been beheaded and St
Peter was in prison. Then, according to the story,
Herod Agrippa drove the faithful from Palestine, and
twenty-four of the disciples of Jesus, with Maximinus
at their head, were sent by the apostles as
missionaries to Spain and Gaul. St Mary Magdalen
joined them, and Martha and Lazarus followed her
example, the latter being at the time Bishop of Cyprus;
they embarked unmolested, and were carried by the
south-east wind to the shores of Southern Gaul, where
Maximinus became Bishop of Aix in Provence. The
other disciples distributed themselves over the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
provinces, of which there were seventeen in Gaul and
seven in Spain—twenty-four in all, just the number of the
disciples. As a matter of fact, Spain and Gaul did comprise
this number of provinces, not however in the time
of Christ, but in the fifth century, as the <i>Notitia Dignitatum</i>
shows. This betrays the late origin of the legend.
St Mary Magdalen is said to have lived at Aix with
Bishop Maximinus, and to have often preached there to
the faithful. According to other accounts, she is said to
have passed thirty years in a life of solitude and penance
in the cave of the Ste Baume, near Marseilles, while
Lazarus is said to have been Bishop of Marseilles,
where he died a martyr.</p>

<p>More trustworthy, though not so interesting, is the
information which we find in Greek sources concerning
Lazarus and his sisters. From these we learn no more
than that the Emperor Leo VI. in 887 built a church
in his honour in Constantinople, and in 899 a monastery;<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>
thither the relics of Lazarus, but not those of his sisters,
were translated from Citium in Cyprus, where they had
hitherto reposed. The menology of Basil and the
calendars of the Copts and Syrians show that St Mary
Magdalen was honoured in the Greek Church on the
22nd July. The resurrection of Lazarus was specially
commemorated in the Constitution of Manuel Comnenus
on the second Saturday before Easter.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>In the West the earliest traces of the cultus of St Mary
Magdalen are found in Bede, and then in the martyrologies
of Rabanus, Ado, and Usuardus, always on the
22nd July, and with the designation, “Natale.” The
<i>Hieronymianum</i> does not mention Lazarus and St Mary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
Magdalen, but the name of Martha occurs five times;
however, the sister of Lazarus cannot be intended,
for the days (29th July and 17th October) are not
those on which she is commemorated. Although
the first-named martyrologies contains the mention
of St Mary Magdalen, it knows nothing of her
voyage to the South of France. Usuardus, indeed,
puts Lazarus and Martha together on the 17th December,
but merely says that a church was erected in their
honour at Bethania. As far as the service-books are
concerned, the name of St Mary Magdalen appears
for the first time in a missal of Verona of the tenth
century, and then in some missals of the eleventh
century, but the missals of the Roman rite (secundum
consuetudinem Rom. curiæ) mentions her only in the
thirteenth century; it is the same with regard to St
Martha.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Even to the present time Lazarus has not
obtained a place in the Roman Breviary, but his commemoration
is sanctioned for certain localities on the
17th December. The lections for his office contain
no account of his life.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Roman Breviary is significant as
indicating the change of views. The lections for St
Mary Magdalen are simply taken from a homily of St
Gregory, and contain no references to her life, while those
of the much later office of St Martha (29th July) contain
the more recent form of the legend with the later
additions. They know nothing, however, of the pseudo-Rabanus,
according to whom St Mary and her companions
were forcibly placed by the Jews on board a
boat without rudder or sail, and yet, notwithstanding,
reached Marseilles in safety.</p>

<p>With regard to St Mary Magdalen in particular, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
tradition must not be overlooked which states that she
was originally buried in Ephesus; this is maintained
by Gregory of Tours at the end of the sixth century,
and then, at the beginning of the seventh century,
Bishop Modestus of Jerusalem states that St Mary
joined St John at Ephesus after the death of our Lady,
and there suffered martyrdom; the third witness is
Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt, who visited her grave in
Ephesus.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> In 887, as we have said, Leo VI., the Philosopher,
placed her relics in the Church of St Lazarus,
which he had built in Constantinople, but the writers
who mention this fact do not imply that her relics
were translated from Cyprus, as some modern writers
arbitrarily assert, on account of the mention of St
Lazarus’ relics being brought from that island on the
same occasion.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> However this may be, the tradition says
nothing about St Mary Magdalen being the sister of
Lazarus; in fact, she is described by Glycas as a daughter
of Simon the Leper. This tradition furnishes fresh
grounds for the belief that the account of the translation
of St Mary’s relics refers to a truly historical
event.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p>The investigation of scholars have brought to light
the following facts as throwing light upon the Provencial
legend: (1) An early sarcophagus at Marseilles,
belonging to a certain Lazarus, Bishop of Aix (407-417),
who was thought to be the Lazarus mentioned in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
New Testament; (2) the existence of reputed relics of
St Mary Magdalene in the Monastery of Vezelay in the
diocese of Autun. The earliest official mention of
Lazarus is in a decree of Pope Benedict IX. of the
year 1040<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>; this pope consecrated the Church of St
Victor at Marseilles, and from this date the legend developed
rapidly. Its complicated history has been
clearly set forth in the investigations of L. Duchesne
and J. Rietsch; the latter shows that it is probable
the Emperor Leo VI. presented the relics of St Lazarus
to the widowed Empress Richardis on her visit to
Constantinople during her travels in the East; she
probably gave them to the Convent of Andlau in Alsace,
over which she presided.</p>

<p>Among the numerous works on this subject we may
mention: M. Faillon, <i>Monuments Inédites sur l’Apostolat
de Sainte Marie Madeleine en Provence</i> (a collection of
all documents genuine and otherwise bearing on the
question), Paris, 1848. Lacordaire, <i>Vie de Sainte Marie
Madeleine</i>, Paris, 1860, popularised the legend, and made
it a point of national honour to defend it. L. Clarus
(Volk), <i>Geschichte des Lebens, der Reliquien und des
Kultus der heiligen Geschwister Magdalena</i>, <i>etc.</i> Regensburg,
1852, is uncritical, but pleasantly written. L.
Duchesne, <i>Sainte Marie Madeleine</i>, Toulouse, 1892.
J. Rietsch (<i>Die Nachevangelische Geschichte der Bethanischen
Geschwister</i>, <i>etc.</i>, Strassburg, 1902) has probably
settled the question of the relics by his careful
investigations.</p>

<h5>(2) ST CECILIA</h5>

<p>A parish church was dedicated to St Cecilia in Rome
as early as 499, to which two priests were attached, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
a cemetery was named after her fellow-sufferers, Tiburtius
and Valerian, in the sixth century. No further information
respecting her cultus has come down to us
from antiquity, and in the literature of the patristic
period, with the exception of Venantius Fortunatus in
the sixth century, her name is not mentioned. Her
cultus was apparently limited to Rome, although she
had a chapel or church in Ravenna,<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> as the poet just
mentioned states.</p>

<p>A change took place when Pope Paschal I. in 821
discovered the saint’s body, in consequence, as he said,
of a vision; until then it was believed that the
Lombards had carried it away with them. Paschal
had the body taken from the cemetery of SS. Sixtus and
Prætextatus, where he found it, and brought to her
church in Rome, where it still remains. Immediately
after her death, according to the statement in her <i>Passio</i>,
her body must have been placed in the papal crypt.<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
Her name was then inserted in the martyrologies of
Ado, Usuardus, and Rabanus Maurus, and placed under
the 22nd November, which is certainly the day of the
translation of her relics, for the <i>Hieronymianum</i> in its
oldest recension gives the 16th September as the day
of her death (<i>Natalis</i>). St Cecilia appears in Bede and
in the Frankish calendars of the eighth century composed
under Roman influence, but in the most ancient calendar
of Carthage, one looks for her name in vain.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> After
the miraculous discovery of her relics and their translation,
on account of the interest taken in such matters
in the ninth century, her fame spread throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
whole Christian world; and churches were dedicated to
her, even in the recently converted North Germany.</p>

<p>From the point of view we are considering, sufficient
has been said about St Cecilia, still we cannot omit the
opportunity of making some remarks on the date and
circumstances of her martyrdom. We have a full
account of it in the <i>Passio S. Cæciliæ</i>, which, according
to Fachmäuner, was drawn up at the end of the fifth
or beginning of the sixth century. This document
states that Cecilia was condemned to death and executed
by a prefect of Rome called Turcius Almachius; a
Roman bishop (papa urbanus) placed her body in the
papal crypt, and dedicated her house as a church;
this pope had already been a confessor for the Faith
on two occasions before the death of St Cecilia. These
statements cause great difficulty, since Pope Urban
I. (223-230), who can alone be meant here, lived during
the reign of the Emperor Alexander Severus, who was
very well disposed towards the Christians, and during
whose reign they were free from persecution. It is
exceedingly improbable that a high official could have
persecuted them in Rome, under the eyes of the emperor,
in the way described in the <i>Passio</i>. It is impossible
that Pope Urban I. could have twice been a confessor
at this time, and no evidence of such a thing exists;
moreover, we have no evidence for the existence of a
prefect of Rome called Turcius in that period, but we
do find persons of this name in official positions in the
time of Constantine and later. All this, taken along
with the circumstance that it was a time of much unsettlement
in Rome, agrees well with the fourth century,
when the emperor was seldom in the capital, but does
not suit the reign of Alexander Severus.</p>

<p>The fact that St Cecilia appears neither in the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
Roman Calendar, the <i>Depositio Episcoporum</i>, nor in the
chronographer of 354, points to the conclusion that she
must belong to the reign of Julian. All the indications
of time agree with this date; the only thing against
it is the name of the contemporary pope—Urban;
this may be an error, but how the name found its
way into the <i>Passio</i> can be explained on various
grounds; either the original text did not contain the
pope’s name, which was introduced by mistake at a
later date by some redactor of the original document,
or, if the words “papa urbanus” were in the original
document, they are to be taken in the sense of “Bishop
of the city of Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> This falls in with the pontificate
of Liberius all the better, since, in the years 355-365,
he was opposed by an anti-pope, Felix, who had a
small following, and spent his time mostly outside
Rome, where also he died.</p>

<p>The circumstance that the pope, whatever his name
may have been, had been twice a confessor for the
Faith also suits Liberius, who had been banished under
the Arian Constantius to Berœa (355-357). After the
Councils of Seleucia and Rimini in 359, Constantius even
desired his death, because he refused to subscribe to the
Arian Creed, and he was obliged to remain in hiding for
two years in the catacombs until the death of the tyrant
(November 361).<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>The opinion that the martyrdom of St Cecilia took
place under Alexander Severus has hitherto received
the most support, and the difficulties have been explained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
on the supposition that it happened while the
emperor was absent from the capital; this, however,
is arbitrary, and does not really remove the other difficulties.
There is no need to dwell upon the dates
which have been assigned in more recent times. With
regard to the more ancient dates, Ado, Usuardus, and
De Rossi place the martyrdom under Marcus Aurelius
and Commodus, plainly on account of the use of the
plural by the prefect when he said (c. 24) “the emperors”
had commanded that the Christians should be punished
by death, but this general command was repeated during
all the persecutions from Nero to Diocletian. Less wide
of the mark is the most ancient attempt of all to fix the
date, <i>i.e.</i>, made by the first compiler of the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>,
for although not remarkable for historical knowledge,
he places the death of Cecilia under Diocletian.</p>

<p>The family of the Turcii did not belong to Rome, but
came from Samnium, where one of the name in the
third century is mentioned as a proprietor of brick
works in Aufidena.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> Various members of the family
quickly made their way to high offices in the State,<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
and in the summer of 363 a Turcius Apronianus was
prefect of Rome, where he distinguished himself as a
persecutor of the Christians. His wife, however, was
a sister of the elder Melania, St Jerome’s pupil, through
whose influence the whole family was baptised in 397.
As a Christian Turcius Apronianus enjoyed the friendship
of St Paulinus of Nola and the priest Rufinus.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
His descendants flourished all through the fifth century,
at the end of which a Turcius Asterius Secundus was
consul. All this, taken in conjunction with the influential
position of the family, easily accounts for the
absence, in ecclesiastical literature of a subsequent
period, of references to St Cecilia, at whose death a
Turcius had played such an evil part. Otherwise it
would be incredible that the preacher and poets of
that date should have passed over a story which presented
so many points of interest.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Nothing more is
known of Turcius Almachius than what is related in
the passion of St Cecilia. He must have been prefect
from the end of 361 to the autumn of 362.</p>

<p>When all has been said, we must admit that the
account of St Cecilia’s martyrdom, as it has come down
to us, gives rise to serious difficulties from whatever
point of view we regard it. Tillemont and Baillet
were inclined to regard it as lacking all authority. The
only way to give full force to all the facts of the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
is to place it in the period to which it really belongs,
<i>i.e.</i> to the reign of Julian the Apostate.</p>

<h5>(3) ST CATHERINE</h5>

<p>The Festival of St Catherine, though only of late
introduction, quickly spread throughout the whole
of Western Christendom; not only did Faculties of
Theology select her as their patroness, but her day
(25th November) was widely adopted for annual fairs,
and her name was frequently given to children of both
noble and lowly families. The original form of her
name was Æcaterina (Αἰκατερίνα), the modern Russian
Jekaterina; its derivation from the Greek <i>katharos</i>
cannot, therefore, be maintained. Catherine is said
to have been a noble virgin of Alexandria, who, according
to the legend, expostulated with the tyrant Maxentius
on account of his cruelty during the Diocletian
persecution, and was, in consequence, seized by him
and forced to hold a disputation with fifty philosophers.
Not only did St Catherine hold her own against the
philosophers, but even won them over to Christianity;
whereupon the empress, who had heard of her wisdom,
visited her in prison, escorted by two hundred soldiers.
The soldiers, however, along with their captain, were
converted also, and condemned to death in a body
by the emperor. The martyr herself was next tortured,
milk, instead of blood, flowing from her wounds, and then
put to death by the sword. So far the legend as given
by Metaphrastes; the carrying of her body by angels
to Mount Sinai is a later addition.</p>

<p>It does not require much exercise of the critical
faculty to realise the improbabilities of this story, and
at the present day critics are all but unanimous<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
rejecting it; and so we need only concern ourselves with
it here in so far as it has given rise to the Feast of St
Catherine. In this connection we observe that not
only the ancient Church as a whole knew nothing of
St Catherine, but, what is still more to the point, neither
the Syrian nor Egyptian Calendars published by Selden
and Mai make any mention of this remarkable martyr.
Among the Greeks, the <i>Menologium Basilianum</i> is the
first to mention her, while in the Latin Church she does
not appear until the fourteenth century. Durandus,
although he treats of all the important saints’ days,
does not name St Catherine, neither does the <i>Liber
Ordinarius</i> of Siena concluded in 1263. In the numerous
Italian missals consulted by Ebner, St Catherine is
usually found only in the supplements which date from
the fourteenth century. In the body of the missal,
she appears only in the missal of Trani, belonging to
the end of the thirteenth century. It is not difficult
to fix the period at which the legend met with general
acceptance, for St Catherine is absent from the
menology of Constantinople, but is commemorated as
a martyr of the second class in that of Basil. To this
period belongs three Latin poems found among the
works of Alfanus,<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Abbot of Monte Cassino, and later
Archbishop of Salerno (1058-1085). Alfanus, whom
St Peter Damian calls a lover of truth, but who is proved
to have been very credulous by a story which he tells
of some unnamed Byzantine monarch,<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> appears to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
have been the first to make the legend known in the
West. The origin of the story is lost in obscurity,
and, as in the case of the legend of St Lazarus, we have
hitherto been unable to discover reliable data on which
to base any conclusion. The story of St Catherine
may well be one of those popular tales, drawn up in a
historical form, which were circulated in the Middle
Ages, and occupied the place of poetic fiction. Its excision
at any early date from the service-books is much to
be desired in the interests of the respect due to them.</p>

<h4>11. <i>The Festival of All Saints</i></h4>

<p>The Festival of All Saints has no intimate connection
with the ecclesiastical year, but is of the nature of an
addition from without, and, like the saints’ days, is
fixed for a special date. In the earliest ages the
Church paid an external cultus to the martyrs alone,
among whom she included, at an early date, St John
the Baptist, but it was only in the course of centuries
that other saints, not martyrs, attained to this distinction.
The cultus of simple confessors, however,
formed at first quite the exception, and only became
general along with the introduction of canonisations.
Thus in the early ages there was no Festival of All Saints,
but only a commemoration of all the martyrs, the
intention being that no martyr might be left unhonoured.
Their number had been increased to such an extent
by the Diocletian persecution, that it was no longer
possible to celebrate a special commemoration of each
one separately, and so many martyrs had to be passed
over; thus a commemoration of all the martyrs was
instituted as a matter of course.</p>

<p>As far as we know at present, we first meet with this
commemoration in the Church of Antioch, which, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
the first Sunday after Pentecost, kept a commemoration
of all the holy martyrs. We have some sermons of
St John Chrysostom preached on this day.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> In course
of time the feast became general throughout the East,
and an All Saints’ Sunday finds a place in the Eastern
calendars, while the Uniats have accepted the Roman
date for the feast.</p>

<p>In the West the festival passed through the following
phases. The Emperor Phocas († 4th October 610), as
master of Rome and lord of Central Italy, gave the
Pantheon to Boniface IV. at the pope’s request. The
building had been erected by Agrippa in honour of
Augustus in 27 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The learned are not agreed as to
whether it was originally a temple or a bath (Laconicum
sudatio), but it had certainly statues of the gods in the
niches which adorn its interior; however, in the seventh
century it no longer served its original purpose, and
its maintenance was a source of expense to the imperial
treasury. The pope had the building cleansed and made
into a church, which he dedicated to our Lady and all
the martyrs;<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> the day of the dedication was the 13th
May (609 or 610), which thus came to be observed in
Rome as a commemoration of all the holy martyrs.</p>

<p>A second stage in the early development of the
feast was reached in the next century, when Gregory
III. (731-741) dedicated an oratory in St Peter’s to
“the Redeemer, His holy Mother, all the Apostles,
Martyrs, Confessors, and all the just and perfect who
are at rest throughout the whole world.” In this oratory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
the monks were to celebrate vigils and say mass in
honour of the saints.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Here we have the same idea
manifested which underlies the Festival of All Saints.
A Roman basilica had been already dedicated in honour
of all the apostles, and the day of its dedication, the
1st May, probably served as a commemoration of all
the apostles. The Church of “S. Maria ad Martyres,”
the Pantheon, was, moreover, thoroughly restored by
Gregory III.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>The third and decisive stage in the progress was
reached under Gregory IV. (827-844). A mediæval, but,
in this case, well-informed writer states that a great
number of pilgrims went annually to Rome for the
Feast of all the Martyrs (13th May), and that, since the
supply of provisions in Rome in spring was insufficient
for the support of both pilgrims and inhabitants, Gregory
IV. changed the feast from the 13th May to the 1st
November.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Frankish writers of the same period inform
us that this pope exhorted Louis the Pious to introduce
the festival into France, and that Louis, with the consent
of all the bishops of Gaul and Germany, accordingly
ordered it to be observed throughout his empire in
835.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span></p>

<p>Many writers on this account give this as the year
in which the festival was instituted, and attribute its
origin to Louis the Pious, but in this they are mistaken.
Sixtus IV. (1471-1484) provided All Saints’ with an
octave.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<h4>12. <i>The Commemoration of All Souls</i></h4>

<p>The pious duty of prayer for the departed (2 Machabees
xii. 46) finds expression in private and public devotions.
The public prayers usually take place on stated days, <i>i.e.</i>
the day of the death, the seventh and thirtieth days
after death, and the anniversary; the observance
of these devotions is left in the hands of the relatives
and friends of the deceased. The religious Orders began
at an early date to observe these pious customs with
regard to their own departed members.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Besides this,
for the last thousand years a particular day in the year
has been set apart for the commemoration of all the
departed in general; this was the 2nd November, or,
if the 2nd fell on a Sunday, the 3rd. The impulse
which led to its introduction into the ritual of
the Church came from Cluny, for in 998 the Abbot
Odilo issued an ordinance to this effect (the so-called
<i>Statutum S. Odilonis pro Defunctis</i>)<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> to all the monasteries
of his congregation. In this it was directed that in
all monasteries of the Order on the 1st November, after
vespers, the bell should be tolled and the office of the
dead recited, and on the next day all the priests of the
congregation were to say mass for the repose of the
faithful departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p>This example found imitators without there being
any legislation on the point. Other Orders speedily
took it up, such as the Benedictines and Carthusians,
etc.;<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> but it was longer before the secular clergy adopted
this practice in each diocese. The date of its introduction
varies greatly in different countries; it will
be sufficient for us to give a few dates for which we
have certain information, which have a special interest
for us.</p>

<p>The first diocese to adopt All Souls’ Day seems to
have been Liège, where it was introduced by Bishop
Notker († 1008).<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> It appears in the martyrology of
Besançon, called after Bishop Protadius, and compiled
between 1053 and 1066; it is mentioned in the fourteenth
of the Roman Ordos, which belongs to the
thirteenth century; it is not found in the Cologne
Calendar of the same century, nor in the more ancient
one published by Binterim; it is also absent from a
calendar put out in 1382.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<p>We have more detailed information respecting the
Church of Milan. Bishop Otricus (1120-1125) had
already introduced the observance of All Souls’ Day,
but placed it on the day following the dedication of
the cathedral, <i>i.e.</i> the 15th October. This arrangement
continued to the time of St Charles Borromeo, who in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
1582 adopted the Roman, or rather the original date.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
In the Greek and Russian Churches the commemoration
of the departed is kept on the Saturday before the Sunday
“Apoecros,” which corresponds to our Septuagesima
Sunday. The Armenians keep it on Easter Monday.</p>

<h4>13. <i>The Festivals of the Angels</i></h4>

<p>The existence of higher and purely spiritual beings
formed part of the religious belief of the Jews; they
are mentioned in countless passages of the Old Testament,
but no worship was paid directly to them by
the Synagogue. In the Christian Church the cultus
of the angels, especially of St Michael, can be traced
back to remote antiquity. In more recent times
special days have been set apart in honour of the other
two angels named in the Holy Scriptures, and also of
the Guardian Angels; St Gabriel is honoured on the
18th March, St Raphael on the 24th October.</p>

<p>The first Christian emperor built a church in honour
of St Michael on the headland called Hestiæ on the
Bosphorus. It was built on the spot called Anaplus,
distant from Constantinople seventy stadia by land and
thirty-five by water. The place afterwards took the
name of Michaelion, after the church. On the opposite
headland on the Asiatic shore Justinian also erected a
church of St Michael. Nicephorus makes Constantine
the founder of both churches, but Theophanes speaks
only of one built by him.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> According to Du Cange,
there is said to have been no fewer than fifteen churches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
and chapels of St Michael in Constantinople and the
neighbourhood in the Middle Ages. Other towns also
erected, at an early date, churches dedicated to St
Michael, as, for example, Ravenna in 545. St Michael
enjoyed special veneration at the same period at Chonæ
in Phrygia,<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> an ancient and celebrated place of pilgrimage,
and the chief centre in the Byzantine Empire of the
cultus of the angels.</p>

<p>Chonæ, the present Khonas on the Lycus, situated
on a tributary of the Mæander in the ecclesiastical
province of Laodicea, is the name given since the
ninth century to the ancient Colossæ, to the Christian
community of which city St Paul addressed one of his
epistles, wherein he already speaks of the worship of
angels. Even in the time of the apostles there existed
a half-Jewish, half-Gnostic sect which disturbed the peace
of the local church by teaching that Christ was inferior
to the angels, who must be worshipped and invoked
in preference to Him; St Paul (Colossians ii. 18) rejects
this teaching as heretical, nevertheless, it did not
die out, for in the fourth century the Council of Laodicea
was compelled to censure this false worship of the
angels in its thirty-fifth canon.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> This was not a prohibition
of the cultus of the angels in general, for at the same
period St Ambrose and St Hilary in other parts of the
Church exhorted the faithful to invoke them.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> The
true worship of the angels existed also in Colossæ, for
Metaphrastes tells us that an apparition of the Archangel
Michael himself took place there, in honour of
which Manual Comnenus later on prescribed that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
Festival of the Apparition of St Michael should be kept
as a festival of the second class on the 6th September
(Apparitio S. Michælis in Chonis).</p>

<p>The first church dedicated to the Archangel in Rome,
or rather in its neighbourhood, seems to have enjoyed
great veneration. The oldest Roman sacramentary,
which goes by the name of Leo the Great, gives no less
than five masses for the anniversary of its dedication;
in three of them St Michael is mentioned by name in the
prayers or prefaces. From the fact that in the other
masses the angels in general are spoken of without
special mention of St Michael, we must not conclude,
as many liturgical writers have done, that they deal with
the cultus of the angels in general. The church was
situated, according to subsequent information, on the
Via Salaria at the sixth milestone from Rome; but
beyond this nothing further is known about it.
These masses for the day of the Consecration of the
Basilica of the Holy Angel in the Via Salaria<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> are placed
on the 30th September in the <i>Leonianum</i>. As regards
later Roman sacramentaries, the prayers for a mass in
honour of St Michael are given in the <i>Gelasianum</i> on
the 29th September. The <i>Gregorianum</i> gives on the
same day the dedication of the basilica of St Michael
without the addition “in via Salaria.”<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> It is probable
that another church of St Michael is meant here whose
dedication took place on the 29th and not the 30th
September. The day of this church’s dedication has
continued to our own time to be kept as the Festival
of St Michael the Archangel.</p>

<p>In the city itself there was also a church erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
in honour of St Michael, the date and founder of which
are both unknown. Among the ecclesiastical buildings
of Pope Symmachus (498-514) in the city of Rome,
the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i> says that he enlarged and beautified
the basilica of St Michael.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> A church of St Michael
was also built by a pope of the name of Boniface near
the Circus Flaminius,<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> and, in the ninth century, the
Church of St Michael <i>in Sassia</i> was also erected.</p>

<p>The Churches of the West accepted the Roman date,
the 29th September, for the Feast of St Michael,<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> and
in the Middle Ages it ranked as a holy day of obligation,
especially in England, where King Ethelred in 1014
provided it should be observed with a vigil and a preparatory
fast of three days.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> In Germany the Council
of Mainz (813) in its thirty-sixth canon established it
as a festival; and the imperial banner, to be carried
in battle, bore the figure of St Michael. In France the
feast was established by the sixty-first canon of the
diocesan Synod of Tours in 858. In Constantinople
the feast was observed on the 8th November; it is
marked in the menology as the Synaxis of the Archangel
Michael, while in the <i>Basilianum</i> the same day is called
only a Synaxis of the Archangel. In the later Coptic
Calendar of Calcasendi, St Michael occurs no less than
six times (7th April, 6th June, 5th August, 9th
September, 8th November, and 8th December). In the
Syrian lectionary he is set down in the 6th September.</p>

<p>In the course of the sixth century a second Festival
of St Michael began to be celebrated in the West, in
consequence of an apparition near Sipontum on Monte<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
Gargano which took place on the 8th May; the year,
unfortunately, is not known, but the Bollandists place
it in the interval between 520 and 530. Since Monte
Gargano, like Chonæ in the East, became a famous
Western place of pilgrimage, this local festival gradually
came to be observed in other places in the West. The
calendars and martyrologies frequently confuse it with
the feast of the 29th September, as, for example, the
two oldest recensions of the <i>Hieronymianum</i>, those of
Metz and Weissenburg; and similar mistakes occur in
other calendars.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>Gabriel and Raphael have no special commemoration
either in the <i>Hieronymianum</i> or in other ancient martyrologies
and calendars of the Latin Church, neither do
they appear in the Greek menologies; it is only in the
tenth and eleventh centuries that in a few instances
we find them commemorated on special days.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Although
Gabriel appears in the most ancient Coptic Calendar,
it is doubtful whether the day chosen for his commemoration,
the 18th December, is not in the first
instance a commemoration of the Annunciation, and
only secondarily and accidently a feast of the Archangel.
In the same way, his name appears in the Syrian
lectionary on the 26th March, the day after our Lady’s
Annunciation.</p>

<p>A special festival in honour of the Guardian Angels
was first celebrated in the sixteenth century in Spain
on the 1st March,<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> and afterwards in France on the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
free day after Michaelmas. Pope Paul V. permitted
the whole Church to celebrate the Feast of the Guardian
Angels (27th September 1608), and, at the request of
the Emperor Ferdinand II., prescribed its observance
throughout the imperial dominions. Clement IX. in
1667 placed the feast on the first Sunday in September,
and provided it with an octave. Clement X. in 1670
made it a <i>festum duplex</i> of general obligation, and gave
it a fixed place in the calendar on the 2nd October;
the older date, however, still remains in Germany
and in a part of Switzerland.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> Leo XIII. raised it to a
duplex majus.</p>

<h4>14. <i>The Two Festivals in Honour of the Holy Cross</i><br>
(<i>3rd May and 14th September</i>)</h4>

<p>The discovery of the true cross is ascribed to St Helena,
the mother of Constantine the Great. Helena was born
about 246 at Drepanum in Bithynia, of humble origin,
having served as maid in an inn (stabularia) where Constantine
Chlorus made her acquaintance about 273. From
their union sprang the future Emperor Constantine,
born on 27th February 274 at Naïssus, now Nisch in
Servia. When Constantine Chlorus was raised to the
rank of Cæsar on 1st March 292, he, like his colleague,
had to separate from his wife (whether Helena or another
is disputed), in order to form a more influential alliance,
with Theodora, daughter of Maximianus Hercules, by
whom he had three sons.</p>

<p>But in 306, when Constantine after his father’s
death became the emperor’s colleague and Cæsar, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
raised his mother to a position of honour and brought
her to the court. When, in 311, he professed Christianity,
Helena also followed his example, and at the age
of sixty-four or sixty-five became a Christian. The
misfortunes of her son’s family life disturbed her last
years, and she was especially grieved at the death of
her grandson Crispus, whom Constantine caused to be
murdered in 326, at the instigation of his stepmother
Fausta.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> As a pious Christian she found consolation
in the performance of good works, to which she devoted
herself. She died in 326, and her body was buried at
Rome in the Via Lavicana, but two years later it was
taken to Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> In her honour Constantine
changed the name of her birthplace to Helenopolis, and
bestowed upon her the title of Augusta; on medals
she is called Flavia Julia Helena.</p>

<p>She obtained great honour after her death, and in
Jerusalem especially her memory was held in veneration
by the religious virgins of the locality;<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> St Ambrose
calls her a woman of good and holy memory; St
Paulinus of Nola had a high idea of her worth, and
speaks of her as deserving all veneration, and Theodoret,
although imperfectly informed as to the facts of her
life, praises her exuberantly.<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> As to her admission
among the ranks of the saints, this was effected only
at a late date, and in a few instances. We find her
name, indeed, in the eighth century in the menology of
Constantinople set down along with that of her son
on the day of his death (21st May). This shows that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
the author of the menology was ignorant of the day
of her death, and also that no cultus was paid to her
immediately after her decease; still, to both the term
saint is applied in this document. No trace of her
cultus appears in the West before the ninth century.
The most ancient MSS. of the <i>Hieronymianum</i> do not
contain her name; she is not to be found either in
Bede or Ado; Usuardus has placed her in his martyrology
under the 18th August,<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> and from him her commemoration
passed into the Roman martyrology on
the same day, but in the other liturgical books she
has no place.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> When we find “S Helena” in a graffito
or in an itinerary, this cannot be regarded as a fact
of much importance.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>Soon after he became sole emperor, Constantine
decided to erect a church over the Holy Sepulchre at
Jerusalem. According to Eusebius,<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> the heathen had
filled up the place with rubbish, raised the level of the
ground, and built a temple to Venus on the site. This
was now destroyed, the rubbish removed, and deep
under the surface the cave of the Holy Sepulchre was
discovered.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> The emperor’s letter to Bishop Macarius
of Jerusalem concerning the building of the church
is given in full by Eusebius. The erection of the
building was undertaken at once, and Eusebius has
given us a full description of it.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> At this point
Eusebius begins to speak of Helena, and relates how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
she came to the East and visited the holy places, and
on this occasion she gave rich presents to the
churches which her son had built both in Bethlehem
and on the Mount of Olives.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> Whereupon Eusebius
relates the death of Helena, but of her discovery of
the Holy Cross he says not one word; it is only in
his Commentary on the Psalms (lxxxvii. 11; cviii.
29) that certain mysterious expressions are found which
may refer to it.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> This silence is all the more remarkable
since Jerusalem belonged to the ecclesiastical province
of Cæsarea, and Eusebius must in any case have known
of the event.</p>

<p>Later historians and writers, beginning with Socrates
and Sozomen,<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> have a great deal to say upon the subject.
According to them, the cross of our Lord, and those also
of the two thieves, along with the title written by Pilate,
were all found deep under the surface of the ground;
but the cross on which our Lord suffered could not be
distinguished from the other two. Bishop Macarius
solved the difficulty by obtaining a miracle from
God, in answer to his prayers; the three crosses
were laid, one after another, upon a sick woman,
in the belief that she must be cured when touched by
our Lord’s cross. And so it happened, as the third
cross touched her body, she recovered. This healing
of a sick person has become in later writers, as, for example,
in Paulinus of Nola,<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> a resurrection from the
dead, showing in this, as in other cases, the development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
of the legend. In addition, the nails of the cross were
also found, and these, along with half of the cross, were
sent by Helena to her son in Constantinople; the other
half was preserved in Jerusalem in a silver shrine in a
chapel specially built for its reception.</p>

<p>Socrates, from whom these details are taken, places
these events after his account of the Nicene Council;
many writers place them in the year after the Council,
but this is incorrect, since in that year Helena died;
the Alexandrine Chronicle alone, which in such matters
is very reliable, gives the day and the year for these
events, <i>i.e.</i> 14th September 320.<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Other authorities
give a yet earlier date; indeed, a Syrian legend relates
that a certain Protonika had discovered the Holy Cross
during the reign of Tiberius.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>The day of the discovery of the Holy Cross was kept
annually at Jerusalem with great ceremony, all the more
as the consecration of the church was kept on the same
day. The two principal churches in Jerusalem, the
one on Golgotha, which bore the title of <i>Martyrium</i> and
<i>Ad Crucem</i>, and the other, also built by Constantine,
and called the <i>Anastasis</i>, were both consecrated on the
same date, <i>i.e.</i> the 14th September.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Already in the
fourth century numbers of pilgrims came to Jerusalem
to celebrate this festival; they came from distant
countries, from Mesopotamia and Egypt, and among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
them several bishops were to be found. The Gallic
pilgrim, of whom we have so often spoken, was present
at this festival, and has left an interesting description
of it, and a later pilgrim, the penitent Mary of Egypt,
was converted on the occasion of the festival. We have
already related how the Holy Cross was exposed for
the veneration of the faithful every year in Jerusalem
on Good Friday.</p>

<p>The 14th September was at first only a local festival
at Jerusalem and in those other towns which possessed
portions of the Holy Cross, such as Constantinople and
Apamea; it spread afterwards to other places, and
soon became universal in the East. It is called in
the East the Exaltation of the Cross (ὕψωσις τοῦ τιμίου
καὶ ζωοποιοῦ σταυραῦ, or τῶν ἁγίων ξύλων), from which
is taken its Western name, <i>Exaltatio Crucis</i>, but the
pilgrim Theodosius, who visited the Holy Land about
530, employs the correct term, the Finding of the
Cross (inventio crucis).<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> According to the menology
of Constantinople, the festival was preceded by a preparation
of four days (10th to 13th September). On the
three last days of Holy Week the court and all the
high officials took part in the public worship of the
Holy Cross, as we learn from a writer<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> of the seventh
century. The Coptic calendars usually prolong the
celebration during three days.</p>

<p>In the seventh century the relic of the Holy Cross
was connected with an event of great importance.
Chosroes II., King of Persia, began to make war against
the Eastern Empire at the time when Heraclius ascended
the throne; he captured the cities of Apamea and
Edessa, and defeated the Greeks in several engagements;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
in June 614 his general Salbarus took Jerusalem
with great slaughter. He laid waste the churches, and
carried off to Persia, with the rest of the booty, the
portion of the Holy Cross which was preserved there.
The course of the war still remained unfavourable
to the Greeks until Heraclius, having made peace with
the Bulgarians, himself led the full strength of his
army against the Persians in 621. The fortune of war
changed, and the Greeks reconquered their lost territory,
being aided in this by internal discord among the
Persians. Chosroes was deposed and murdered in
628; his successor, Siroes, hastened to make peace
with the Greeks, and restored to them the wood of the
Holy Cross. At the end of the year Heraclius returned
as victor to his capital, and at the beginning of the
following year he set out for Syria, taking the Holy
Cross with him. He brought it himself from Tiberias
to Jerusalem,<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> where he handed it over to the Patriarch
Zacharias on the 3rd May, if the traditional date be
correct. Tradition further adds that, arrayed in his
royal robes, he essayed to carry it upon his shoulders,
but at the foot of the hill of Calvary he found himself
unable to proceed further until, upon the advice of
Zacharias, he laid aside his royal apparel. No festival
in commemoration of the event was introduced in the
East, although it was in the West.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the spread of these two festivals
throughout the Church, we must call attention to a
remarkable fact; the day of the discovery of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
Cross by Helena (14th September) naturally existed
as a festival from the first in Jerusalem, from whence
it soon spread throughout the entire eastern half of the
Church, but in the West, although the discovery of the
cross was already well known in the fourth century,
the festival in honour of the event was not adopted, at
least not at once.</p>

<p>It was just the opposite with regard to the recovery
of the cross by Heraclius; the grief at the news of its
loss was equalled by the joy which the whole Christian
world felt at its recovery. While in the East people
remained content with the already existing feast, in
the West the day of the recovery of the cross was kept
as a solemn commemoration, and was placed in the
calendars and martyrologies at an early date; we find
it mentioned by the name “Day of the Holy Cross”
(<i>dies sanctæ crucis</i>) in the lectionary of Silos,
which belongs to about 650—probably the earliest
mention of the festival. The ancient Gallic liturgies
published by Mabillon, both the lectionary and sacramentary,
contain the Festival of the Holy Cross in spring,
but call it “The Finding of the Cross” (<i>Inventio Sanctæ
Crucis</i>).<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> None of these service-books mention the
feast of the 14th September. The <i>Gregorianum</i> has
both feasts, so has the <i>Gelasianum</i>, at all events in
Thomasi’s edition, but the second is a later addition.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>The way in which the <i>Martyrologium Hieronymianum</i>
treats these feasts is worthy of notice. The Weissenburg
Codex, written about 750, has both days; the
Echternach Codex, which represents the oldest form
of the text, has neither, and the Bern Codex, the latest
of the three recensions, has only one, <i>i.e.</i> the 3rd May,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
which, in common with all Latin authorities, it calls
the Finding of the Cross.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The authentic text of Bede
has only the 3rd May, so too has the sacramentary
of Padua, belonging to the first half of the ninth century.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>These notices might easily be increased, but they are
sufficient to show how that in the West, when it was
known that the Holy Cross had been recovered from
the Saracens, the feast of the 3rd May was, in the seventh
century, immediately introduced, but the feast of the
14th September only became known in the eighth
century, and won its way to acceptance slowly and
partially. In many churches it was received quite
late, as for example in Milan in 1035.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PART_III">PART III<br>
<span class="smaller">THE MATERIAL UPON WHICH THE HISTORY OF
THE ECCLESIASTICAL YEAR IS BASED</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>1. <i>The Documentary Sources in General</i></h3>

<p>The sources from which the history of the ecclesiastical
year and the festivals of the saints is drawn are
first of all official documents, namely service-books,
decrees of councils, papal constitutions and bulls; in
the second place come the information derived from
ecclesiastical writers of various periods and countries
which must be used and brought into connection with the
official sources.</p>

<p>Among the liturgical books of the Church, the missals
and breviaries hold the first place. In earlier times these
were differently arranged and had different names from
those which they bear at present. The collects and psalms
in particular employed at the mass were not included
in one volume as they are now, but were taken from
a number of books. The essential prayers of the mass
were contained in the so-called <i>Sacramentarium</i>, in
which were also to be found the collects, prefaces,
and, in certain cases, even the whole canon. The
lections from Holy Scripture, the Epistles and Gospels,
were collected together in the Lectionaries, either all
together, or the Epistles and Gospels in separate volumes;
another name for this kind of book was <i>Comes</i>. The
psalms and other portions to be sung by the choir were
contained in separate books, the Antiphonaries, Graduals,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
and Hymnaries, etc. It was only in the Middle Ages
that for the sake of convenience all the different parts
of the mass were contained together in one volume, called
a <i>missale plenarium</i>, but the separate volumes still
continued in use for certain occasions.</p>

<p>In the course of our investigations, we have often
had to refer to the so-called sacramentaries, of which
the three most ancient belonging to the Roman Church
are also the most important. These are:—</p>

<p>1. <i>Sacramentarium Leonianum.</i> This is a collection
of older formularies which had been already drawn up
by an unknown author, some of which may well
be the work of Leo the Great; the title, which gives
rise to the opinion that Leo was the author of the book,
is due to the first editor. The only existing codex is
in Verona, and is unfortunately imperfect, being deficient
in all that relates to Lent and Easter. Since it contains
a prayer for Pope Simplicius († 483), Rome must be
regarded as the place where it was drawn up, and where
it was used, while the date when it took its present
shape was the pontificate of Felix II. (483-492).</p>

<p>2. The <i>Gelasianum</i>, so called after Gelasius I. (492-496).
This pope did actually compose some liturgical
books, but the <i>volumen sacramentorum</i>, ascribed to him by
Gennadius, cannot have been one of them, since it contains
the four festivals of our Lady which were celebrated
in Rome only after Gregory the Great. On the other
hand it does not contain the stations for the Thursdays
in Lent introduced by Gregory II. (715-731); consequently,
it represents the liturgical usages of the seventh
century, <i>i.e.</i> of the period after St Gregory the Great,
and bears the name of Gelasius incorrectly. It consists
of three books: (1) <i>De Tempore</i>, beginning with Christmas;
(2) <i>De Sanctis</i>, beginning with the 1st January;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
and (3) masses for the ordinary Sundays, votive masses,
and masses for the dead. The number of prefaces
contained in the sacramentary amounts to over a
hundred. The Stowe Missal, which is independent of
the <i>Gelasianum</i>, gives the <i>canon Gelasii Papæ</i>. This
book was drawn up in Rome and was intended for local
usage, but we only possess the MSS., which were
meant for the churches of France; the most ancient
belongs to the end of the seventh century, and was
written apparently for the Abbey of St Denys (Cod.
Vat. Reg. Sueciæ, 316). The other existing codices
only give an edition specially adapted from the original
Roman book for use in the Frankish Empire; this is
shown by the prayer, “Respice propitius ad Romanum
sive Francorum imperium.”</p>

<p>3. <i>The Gregorianum.</i> This represents the Roman rite
of the period of Pope Adrian I. (772-795) and Charlemagne.
It is entirely a compilation of Roman origin
belonging to the eighth century, destined originally
for the use of the popes but afterwards adapted for
general use. The canon stands at the head of the work,
which commences with Christmas, but Advent comes at
the end of the <i>Proprium de Tempore</i>. The <i>Agnus Dei</i>,
added to the text of the mass by Pope Sergius I., is
given here in its place, while it is absent from <i>Gelasianum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
The earliest mention of this work is in the
collection of letters of the popes of the eighth century
known as the <i>Codex Carolinus</i>, in a letter of Adrian I.
to Charlemagne who received a copy of the work
from Adrian between 784 and 791,<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> from which
date it was introduced into the Frankish Empire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
copied, and circulated, and also added to. In his letter
Adrian ascribes a personal share in the production of
the work to his predecessor Gregory, relying, of course,
on the tradition of his Church.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>4. This last-named book gradually supplanted the
ancient liturgies and service-books of Gaul; of these
we possess the <i>Sacramentarium Gallicanum</i>, along with
its lectionary, the <i>Missale Gothico-Gallicanum</i>, and
the <i>Missale Francorum</i>;<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> the Mozarabic missal and
breviary are also very important documents.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical calendars and martyrologies come
next under consideration. As regards the former,
the service-books of which we have been speaking
were on the whole drawn up in accordance with
the local calendar and added both the movable and
immovable feasts as best they could. In proportion
as the number of feasts increased the calendars
were regarded as independent catalogues of festivals,
and are found both as separate documents, or bound up
with the other liturgical books; in the latter case,
they are usually placed at the beginning of the
volume.</p>

<p>While the calendars give merely the names of the
saints or the date of their feasts, the martyrologies or
<i>Synaxaria</i> contain more detailed notices, giving the
place, time, and circumstances of the saints’ death,
rank, etc., according as the compiler had more or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
less material at his disposal; in many instances these
notices have grown into considerable historical narratives,
and on this account, the character of the different martyrologies
varies greatly. As to their employment for
historical purposes, the shorter the contents the higher
the value and trustworthiness of a calendar. The martyrologies
were usually compiled by private individuals,
even when intended for ecclesiastical use, but the
calendars shared in the official character of the liturgical
books of which they formed part, since alterations
could not be made in them without the knowledge and
consent of the authorities of the church or corporation
to which they belonged.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>Manuscript calendars belonging to earlier centuries
exist in large numbers, for all missals and breviaries were
provided with them. Their value for historical research
depends upon their age, and also upon our knowledge
of the locality for which they were drawn up, the
best data for discovering this latter point being afforded
by the names of local saints contained in the calendar
itself. No calendar can be set aside as altogether
useless, for in case of need all can throw light upon the
history of at least their own locality. For this reason,
and for others as well, an increasing amount of attention
has been given to them in recent times, and a large
number of them have been printed (see sect. 10 of this
part). The days marked in the calendars are those of
the saints’ deaths (<i>vid.</i> <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_213">p. 213</a>); but the days
on which their relics were translated to some particular
church are also marked as festivals in the calendar
of the church in question. When in different calendars
different days are given to the same saint, the date in
the calendar belonging to the church where he died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
is usually to be regarded as the day of his death; the
others are days on which his relics were translated.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p>Another class of documents consists of the ordos
drawn up for divine service belonging to particular
countries, dioceses, or the more important ecclesiastical
foundations (ordines, ordinaria; in Greek, typica). These
were not originally drawn up for the course of merely
one year, like our present ordos, but contained the list
of recurring festivals and fasts observed from year to
year in some monastery or cathedral, along with detailed
directions for the performance of divine service. The
most important of these are the thirteen oldest ordos
of the Roman Church, collected and published by
Mabillon, but other dioceses and monasteries as well
as the Church of Rome had similar ordos, some of which
have been already printed,<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> while others still await
publication.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<h3>2. <i>The Earliest Christian Calendars</i></h3>

<p>The worship of the saints, especially of the martyrs,
asserted itself in various ways in the liturgy of the
Church. Among the Latins, it appeared even in the
liturgy of the mass, since special masses in honour
of the saints were composed at an early date for the
commemorations of the most celebrated saints. These
were included in the sacramentaries, and, finally, as
their number continued to increase, they were placed
together in a separate division of the book (<i>proprium
sanctorum</i>), instead of being distributed, as formerly,
over the whole year. Among the Greeks, this was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
possible, since they repeat the same mass daily, and
employ only two or three mass formularies throughout
the entire year.</p>

<p>In the second place, the cultus of the saints gained
a footing in the Canonical Hours, the Psalter, both
among Latins and Greeks. It was customary among
the Latins as early as the sixth century to read a portion
of the account of the martyrdom (passiones martyrum),
as Aurelian of Arles tells us;<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> this was the commencement
of the existing lections of the breviary.
Then collections of lives of the saints for the whole
year were drawn up on the lines of the calendar, which
came to be called martyrologies on account of the
character of the larger part of their contents. In course
of time, two kinds of martyrologies came into existence,
those containing legends of greater length more suited for
private reading, and those distinguished by the brevity
of their notices intended for employment in the
services of the Church. Even these have no immediate
connection with the liturgy, although the names of the
saints for the day were read at Prime, a custom which
possibly the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle of 817 had
in view in its sixty-ninth canon.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> These martyrologies
developed out of the diptychs and calendars of particular
churches, by way of compilation and expansion; like
the calendars, they contain simply the names of the
saints, but with the mention of the locality to which
the saint belonged, and, in many cases, with an indication
of the date at which he lived.</p>

<p>The martyrologies aimed at completeness in other
directions. First, it was attempted to unite together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
the names of all the martyrs who had ever suffered
throughout the whole Church, along with the day of
their death, and secondly, an attempt was made, but only
in later times, to fill up the calendar by allotting every
day in the year to at least one saint. This latter attempt
was made in the West only in the seventh and eighth
centuries, and achieved considerable success. While
the first efforts in this direction attained to only relative
completeness, since they took into consideration only a
part, and not the whole, of the universal Church, as
the Arian and Carthaginian martyrologies had done,
yet the tendency towards universality appears unmistakably
at a later date, especially in the so-called
<i>Martyrologium Hieronymianum</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to the Greek service-books, menology
means the same thing as martyrology—a catalogue
of saints arranged in the form of a calendar according
to the days of the month, and merely giving the name
of the saint against the particular day set apart by the
Church in his honour. The lives of the saints arranged
according to months and days are called Menæa or
Meniæa, and the shorter abstracts from it are called
Synaxaria.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>The list of calendars opens with two documents, the
most ancient of their kind possessed by the Roman
Church, <i>i.e.</i> the lists of popes and martyrs with the
days of their death, which have often been referred to
already—the <i>Depositio Episcoporum</i> from Lucius to
Julius I., and the <i>Depositio Martyrum</i>, a catalogue of
the martyrs of the city of Rome, extending only to 304,
three martyrs not belonging to Rome being included in
this list, Cyprian, Perpetua, and Felicitas. The connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
of these two lists to one another is shown in
their titles (<i>item</i>), and also by the fact that Sixtus, who
is placed among the martyrs, is omitted from the list
of popes. This latter list comprises the period from
Lucius († 255) to Julius († 352) only; either the compiler
had no material at hand for the earlier period,
or he set it aside as not bearing upon the point he had
in view. The list of martyrs contains the names of
popes who were also martyrs, such as St Peter, St
Clement, St Calixtus, St Pontianus, St Fabian, and St
Sixtus; of martyrs, not bishops, we have here the most
famous saints of the city of Rome, St Agnes and St
Lawrence (but not St Cecilia), as well as many other
quite obscure names. In reply to the inquiry what
principle was followed in drawing up this list, Mommsen,<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>
relying on the title which connects the document with
Carthage, replies that it contains “the names of those
martyrs and bishops whose commemoration was celebrated
annually in the Church.” Both these lists were
first published by Ægidius Bucherius (Gilles Boucher),
and form a portion of the work on the Calendar of
Dionysius Philocalus (see above, <a href="#Page_136">p. 136 <i>seqq.</i></a>).</p>

<p>Next in order comes a Calendar of the North African
Church belonging to the fifth century, and edited by
Mabillon from a codex of the seventh century formerly
belonging to the Monastery of Cluny. The original
must have been completed after 505, for Bishop
Eugenius of Carthage is mentioned in it. It contains
St John the Baptist, some apostles and martyrs not
belonging to North Africa, Sixtus, Gervasius and
Protasius, Lawrence, Clement of Rome, Eulalia, Felix<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
of Nola, Agnes, Agatha, Vincent, and the Machabees,
who belong to the Churches of Rome and Spain. Unfortunately,
the list is not quite perfect owing to the
bad state of the MS.</p>

<p>The Calendar of Philocalus for the year 352 contains
nothing definitely Christian.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> On the other hand, the
Calendar of Polemius Silvius, Bishop of Sion, drawn
up between 435 and 455, is interesting as showing a
mixture of Christian and heathen entries. Destination,
character, place, and time of the compilation can be
learnt from the calendar itself; it was not drawn up
for one particular year, at least there is nothing by
which to determine the year, for Dominical letters,
movable feasts, etc., are all wanting; among heathen
festivals we have the <i>Carmentalia</i>, <i>Lupercalia</i>, <i>Terminalia</i>,
<i>Quinquatria</i>, and <i>Lavatio Cereris</i>, all of which recall
heathen religious customs. The <i>Saturnalia</i> are included
on account of their popular, not on account
of their religious significance, and appear as <i>feriæ
servorum</i> on the 17th December, as well as <i>feriæ ancillarum</i>
on the 7th July. In addition, there are many
other popular commemorations, such as the 7th January,
13th September, etc., and a great number of <i>natales</i>
of emperors. The number of ecclesiastical feasts is very
small, being limited to Epiphany, the 25th and 27th
of March as the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ,
Christmas, and six saints’ days—<i>Depositio Petri et Pauli</i>
on the 22nd February instead of the 29th June, Vincent,
the Machabees, Lawrence, Hippolytus, and Stephen
on their usual days. Besides these we have the <i>natales</i>
of authors—Cicero and Virgil, and finally, the days are
marked on which the Senate usually held sittings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
and games were given in the circus. In comparison
with the Calendar of Philocalus, the number of such
days is much reduced; in the former there are over
a hundred, here only fifty-three. The meteorological
entries are numerous. The calendar was evidently
intended for the provinces of the western half of the
empire, and takes into account both the ecclesiastical
and civil requirements, although it deals with the former
to a limited extent.</p>

<h3>3. <i>The Arian Calendar of the Fourth Century</i><br>
(<i>About 370-380</i>)</h3>

<p>One of the most interesting documents in connection
with our subject in virtue of its age, contents, and plan
is the Arian martyrology, published by W. Wright in
1865.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> As is well known, the Arians were an active
party who, until about 380, attempted with some success
to gain the upper hand in the Church. As a means to
this end, it was to their interest to invest their followers
as much as possible with the appearance of sanctity,
and the Arian historian Philostorgius devoted himself
especially to this; he characterises as saints and
workers of miracles Agapetus and a certain Theophilus
who worked in India, and also Aëtius, Eunomius, and
Leontius, the ringleaders of thorough-going Arianism.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
As a consequence of this the Arians encroached in
various ways upon the domain of liturgy also. It
goes without saying that they did not wish to figure as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
heretics, but as forming the true Church, and so they
exhibited a corresponding activity in hagiology.</p>

<p>While, generally speaking, the local churches confined
themselves each to its own diocese, and the
principle of individualism continued to hold its own for a
long time throughout the whole Church, the Arians early
abandoned this method, and even while they did not
completely adopt the principle of universality, yet they
did so partially, their position as a minority among
Christians giving them an impulse in this direction.
Thus we find their martyrology embraces Asia Minor,
Egypt, Greece, Mœsia, Illyria; in fact, the entire eastern
half of the empire, and even Italy and North Africa
are not passed over altogether.</p>

<p>We must first of all turn our attention to the external
and historical side of the document. Wright found it
in a Syrian MS., belonging to Nitria in Egypt, of the
time of Porphyrius, Bishop of Antioch (404-413), and
written in the year 411.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> It consists of two different
parts, of which the first is a martyrology drawn up
in accordance with the calendar, and originally composed
in Greek. Unfortunately, the section from the
1st to the 25th December is missing. This part is the
original document, and was early translated into Syriac,
although, as we shall see later, it is full of defects.
The fact that, nevertheless, it was considered worthy
of being translated, and that by an orthodox translator,
shows that it was regarded as a remarkable piece of
work. What impressed its contemporaries was its
universal character, then quite a novelty. At the end,
there is a somewhat mutilated appendix consisting
of a list of Persian martyrs arranged, not by the
date of their death, but according to their rank in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
the hierarchy, into three groups—bishops, priests,
and deacons.</p>

<p>The second part, originally composed in Syriac, was
an addition of the Syrian translator. Among the
persons named in this part, it is noticeable that there
are no Arians, nor even Nestorians, who, when expelled
from the Roman Empire by Theodosius II. in 435,
made themselves masters of the Persian Church. Of
the sixteen bishops mentioned in the first section, at least
eight are known to have been orthodox Persian martyrs,
all belonging to the period before 400, <i>e.g.</i> Simon
Bar-Sabai, Bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon († 17th April
344), his successor, Schahdust († 346), and Sapor, Bishop
of Beth Gormai.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Miles (Milles), Simeon, Barbasimas,
Joannes, Sapores, Gudiab, Sabinus, Abdos, Paul, and
Ebedjesus are mentioned by Sozomen as Persian martyrs
of the reign of Sapor I.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> This very primitive calendar
contains only the names of martyrs to the exclusion
of other persons who were even regarded as saints,
such as Mares, the second bishop of Seleucia († 82).<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
The compiler calls those whom he included in his calendar
the Holy Martyrs who had been put to death in the
East, while he regards those named in the first part as
the Holy Confessors of the West, regarding the Roman
Empire as the West in respect to Persia.</p>

<p>The first part, which concerns the West, differs
from the second in many respects. It was drawn
up by another hand, and was written originally in
Greek. The latter is a document entirely historical
in character, while the former is liturgical; the one
belongs to Persia, the other to the Roman Empire, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
probably to Nicomedia. It was then employed in
Antioch, where it was enlarged, and finally, as it appears,
was translated into Syriac at Edessa. It forms one
of the most remarkable documents of ancient Christian
literature.</p>

<p>That this Arian martyrology belonged to the Roman
Empire, and especially to its eastern part, is proved by
the calendar employed therein, <i>i.e.</i> the Julian, with the
addition of the Chaldean names for the months, the
days of the month being given simply without reference
to calends and nones and ides. The author is well-informed
with regard to the eastern half of the Roman
Empire; he knows names and date of death of eight
bishops of Antioch, the name Antioch occurs in all
twenty-four times, Nicomedia is named thirty-two
times, but the name of no bishop of Nicomedia is given,
Alexandria is mentioned nineteen times, Constantinople,
Rome, and Jerusalem only twice.</p>

<p>The date of this work is fixed by the mention of the
celebrated Bishop James of Nisibis on the 15th July. He
was alive after 350, when the Persians besieged Nisibis,
and flourished, according to the somewhat vague expression
of the Chronicle of Samuel of Ani, in the 283rd
Olympiad, <i>i.e.</i> 353-356.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Thus the martyrology was
written in the period between 370 and 400, and sometime
about 380, when Arianism was the dominant
religion in the eastern half of the empire.</p>

<p>The Arian character of the martyrology is shown
by the fact that Arius himself is mentioned in it, while
none of the adherents of the Nicene faith of that date
are included, and the only orthodox bishop whose
name appears is James of Nisibis. Since he was
orthodox, and since Nisibis belonged to Persia, his name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
could not have been in the Greek original, which, besides
being Arian, was limited to worthies belonging to the
Roman Empire, but the insertion of his name is probably
due to the orthodox Persian translator.</p>

<p>The compiler drew his information from the works
of his predecessors, to which he made additions of his
own. One of these sources he names, for he states with
regard to the names of eleven personages, that they are
taken from the “Number of the Ancient Confessors.”
He also used an old list of martyrs, which he does not
further describe. To judge by the character of the
quotations from this document, it must have dealt with
the same part of the Church as the new compilation.
Antioch (four times), Synnada, Nicomedia, Pergamus,
and Heracleia are named in it, while Alexandria is not
mentioned. By the “Ancient Confessors” are to be
understood the martyrs before Diocletian, and it is
probable that they were taken from the lists of
“Depositions” belonging to each city, just as the
chronographer has preserved for us those of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>As regards the contents, they resemble those of
similar documents of earlier and later date, and are
fully described in the superscription, which states that
it “contains the names of the Lords, <i>i.e.</i> the saints,
confessors, and victors, and the days on which they
received their crowns.” One would expect to find the
place of their death mentioned as well, but many saints
are given without any indication of the locality to which
they belonged, perhaps on account of imperfect
information on the part of the author. The date of
death is on the whole correctly given, a remarkable
instance to the contrary being the commemoration of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
SS. Peter and Paul, which is placed on the 28th
December. This cannot throw doubt upon the date
observed in Rome itself, for the Greeks were, as a rule,
very imperfectly informed concerning ecclesiastical
events in the Latin portion of the empire. The sources
from which the compiler drew his information cannot
have been very full, for there is no mention of the famous
Western martyrs, Agnes and Lawrence, and, indeed,
beyond the mention on the 1st Ab (August) of Aksitus,
Bishop of Rome, by which Xystus II. is probably intended
(the day of St Xystus’ death was the 6th
and not the 1st August), and of SS. Perpetua and
Felicitas, correctly given on the 7th March, no Western
saints are commemorated.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<p>Among the bishops of Alexandria there are two
mentioned whose names do not occur in the official lists,
Artemon on the 3rd September, and Hodion (Orion)
on the 16th August. Similarly, among the bishops of
Antioch, there are two not mentioned elsewhere,
Amphimelus (4th March) and Philippus (27th March).
Can these have been Arian prelates?</p>

<p>Besides St Peter and St Paul, the only two apostles
commemorated are St John and St James, who held
the most important place in the eastern half of the
empire; they are placed together on the 27th
December, on which day the latter especially was
formerly commemorated. St Stephen, also called an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
apostle (schelico), appears on the day still consecrated
to his memory (26th December).</p>

<p>The bishops, priests, and deacons appear with their
proper titles; all the others have the designation, confessor
(mandaya). This designation implies martyrdom,
for in the first three centuries <i>confessor</i> means a martyr
whose sufferings stop short of death. It is also worthy
of notice that some who appear not to have been martyrs
have to be content with a mere commemoration
(dukrana = <i>commemoratio</i>), as, for example, St Xystus,
James of Nisibis, Eusebius of Cæsarea, etc. The names,
again, of others are merely mentioned without any
addition or title.</p>

<p>Finally, there are still some peculiarities in this
menology which ought to be mentioned. Some of
these may be due to oversight, or to the ignorance of
the compiler, others seem to be mistakes made in
transcribing the document, and ought not to appear
in documents of an official character. Thus Marcianus
of Tomi appears twice (on the 5th and on the 10th
June), Dius once as confessor and once as presbyter
(11th and 12th June). Especially remarkable is the
circumstance that three individuals, whose names occur
in no other calendar, not even in the <i>Menologium</i> of
Constantinople, are given three times, namely, Cosconius,
Melanippus, and Zeno, sons of Theodota, once for
Nicea on the 19th January, once for Asia on the
23rd February, and once for Nicomedia on the 2nd
September. As slips of the pen, we may notice
Hadriopolis for Hadrianopolis, Pedinthus for Perinthus,
Tunjus (10th June) for Tomi, which is elsewhere
spelt correctly, Sindus for Synnada, which once
(30th June) has the addition, “in Phrygia,” and
once (15th June) is without it. The proper names<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
are frequently wrongly spelt, or so confused as to
be unrecognisable.</p>

<p>Of the Church festivals, only Epiphany and Easter
are marked. The MS. is, unfortunately, imperfect where
we should expect to find the 25th of December. On
the Friday after Easter the Commemoration of all the
Confessors, <i>i.e.</i> Martyrs, is set down.</p>

<p>The relation of the Arian martyrology to Eusebius’
work on the Martyrs of Palestine deserves to be considered.
One would expect to find this work often
referred to, but it is not so, and the compiler seems to
have had no knowledge of it. This is all the more
remarkable since Eusebius always gives the dates of
the death of the martyrs. The two works have, however,
very few points of contact, but they confirm one
another in the points where they do coincide. Both
place the death of the priest Pamphilus and his eleven
companions at Cæsarea on the 16th February; both
mention the martyr Romanus at Antioch, Eusebius
placing his death on the 17th November, the martyrology
on the 18th—a trifling discrepancy which proves their
independence of each other. Hermes the Exorcist,
Domnion of Salona, James of Nisibis, etc., are given on
the dates which they occupy in the calendars of other
Churches.</p>

<p>The so-called martyrology of St Jerome has many
names in common with this Arian martyrology. St
Jerome often assigns to one place and day more martyrs
than this Arian Calendar, as, for example, on the 25th
March, Dulas, on the 4th, 18th, and 21st April, etc.
Sometimes the Arian gives more names than St Jerome,
<i>e.g.</i> on the 11th March, the 2nd May, etc., while in some
places they are in perfect agreement, <i>e.g.</i> on the 13th
March, Modestus and twenty-one companions—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
<i>Hieronymianum</i> gives the names of the whole twenty-one,
while here only the number is given—on the 16th
April, Leonidas and eight companions in Corinth, etc.
We cannot infer from this that the compiler of the
<i>Hieronymianum</i> incorporated the work of his Arian
predecessor in his own, but he certainly was acquainted
with it, and made use either of it or of common sources.</p>

<p>The comparison of the Arian martyrology with that
of St Jerome has further led to a curious discovery,<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
<i>i.e.</i> that the entries from the 6th (or more correctly
from the 8th) to the 30th June are indeed included in
the martyrology of St Jerome, but have been bodily
transferred to the corresponding dates in July.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> This
latter month has only three entries, and it has been
thought that the mistake is due to the Arian compiler
or his transcribers, but it is just as likely that the change
of date was made by the author of the <i>Hieronymianum</i>.
How this fact is to be explained must be left to conjecture.
Another important point bearing upon the
connection between the two documents is the fact that
the one mentions Bishop Eusebius of Cæsarea on the
30th May, but the other in more detail on the 21st June,
as follows: <i>In Cæsarea Palæstinæ Dep. Eusebi Epi.
Historiographi</i>. Which is correct? Certainly the
Syrian document, which also gives correctly the day of
Arius’ death. The entry on the 6th June clearly exhibits
the Arian character of the document: “In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
Alexandria, Arius Presbyter.” The fact that he is
merely commemorated, proves that it is incorrect to
suppose, as many do, that another Arius, a reputed, but
otherwise unknown, martyr of Alexandria is intended.
The martyrs in this document are treated to more than
a mere commemoration (dukrana). Accordingly he did
not regard this particular Arius as a martyr.</p>

<p>From the description which we have given of this
highly important document, one is led to expect that
it will throw fresh light on certain historical questions,
and so, as a matter of fact, it does. For instance, we can
fix the death of Arius by its assistance on the 6th June
336. Arius died on a Saturday shortly before sunset.
On the following day he was to have been solemnly
received into the Church.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> The only year which can
be taken into consideration is 336, for in it the 6th June
fell on a Saturday.<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>The historian Eusebius died about the time when
Athanasius returned to Alexandria from his first exile.
This was shortly after Constantine’s death († 22nd May
337). Since Eusebius died soon after he had finished the
life of Constantine, whom he did not long survive, his
death is to be placed on the 30th May 338. This takes
for granted that the Bishop of Palestine mentioned on
the 30th May is identical with the historian, which can
scarcely be called in doubt. Cæsarea was the ecclesiastical
metropolis of Palestine, and this accounts for
his title, Bishop of Palestine.<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> His successor and heir
and biographer was the energetic Acacius.</p>

<p>A more important fact is that the martyrdom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
Bishop Babylas of Antioch can now be definitely
established. We have in this document reliable evidence
that he suffered on the 24th January, which
corresponds with the evidence of Chrysostom, who
stated that the Festival of SS. Juventinus and Maximin,
which was kept on the 4th February, followed closely
on that of St Babylas.<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> Moreover, St Babylas was
generally commemorated on the 24th January. According
to Eusebius,<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Babylas died in prison under
Decius, and, according to Jerome, in the first year of his
reign. Decius reigned from October, or, according to
other authorities, from August 249 to 27th July 251,
and one of his first acts was to inaugurate the persecution
against the Christians. Accordingly the death of
Babylas must have happened on the 24th January 250.
Since all authorities agree in stating that he had been
bishop for thirteen years, we are now able to fix the
year of the death of Zebinas, his predecessor, <i>i.e.</i> 237,
and the day of the month is given as 13th January in
the Arian martyrology. This document must be regarded
as a thoroughly reliable source for the dates of
the death of the Antiochene bishops in particular, and
we can, therefore, place the death of Maximin, the
seventh in the list of bishops, on the 4th February 191,
and the death of Serapion on the 14th May 215.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe that this calendar,
although it is an Arian document, contains not merely
the names of Arian worthies, but many which belong
to Catholic antiquity. It is chiefly to this that it
owes its importance for the history of the Church, and
it is also due to this that it was capable of being combined
with the catalogue of Persian saints, which is an
essentially Catholic document. On the other hand, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
is by no means a complete martyrology, and is in itself
a liturgical, and not a historical, document intended
by its unskilful compiler to serve party ends.</p>

<p>The Goths in Italy had also a menology of their own,
of which a fragment was discovered by A. Mai. Unfortunately,
it contains only the month of November.
It is noteworthy that it mentions the Apostle Andrew,
whose name does not occur in the similar martyrology
of which we have just been speaking. The fragment,
with this exception, contains Gothic names alone.
St Clement and St Cecilia do not appear, which proves
its freedom from Roman influence, and shows that it
was essentially a national production.<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<h3>4. <i>The so-called Martyrologium Hieronymianum</i><br>
(<i>Second Half of the Seventh Century</i>)</h3>

<p>Already in the time of St Gregory the Great there
existed in Rome a complete and universal list containing
merely the names of the martyrs and the place where
they suffered, arranged according to the days of the
year. Eulogius, the contemporary bishop of Alexandria,
besought the pope to send him the complete collection
of the acts of the martyrs drawn up by Eusebius in the
time of Constantine. He believed these were to be found
in Rome. He had doubtless in view the “Collection
of Martyrs” (συλλογὴ τῶν μαρτυρίων) just mentioned.
St Gregory replied that they had in Rome a collection
of the names of all the martyrs in one volume, but no
complete collection of their acts.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span></p>

<p>The work of Eusebius here referred to was not forthcoming
in Alexandria either, and was already regarded
as lost, but the fact that such a work had once existed
was not forgotten. A work of the same kind was also
attributed to St Jerome, which is also no longer in
existence. The senator Cassiodorus exhorts his monks
to read diligently the histories of the martyrs (<i>passiones
martyrum</i>) who have lived throughout the whole world,
in order to stir themselves up to the practice of virtue.
These they will find in the letter written by St Jerome
to Chromatius and Heliodorus. These last words are
somewhat obscure, for it would be impossible to deal
with the acts of all the martyrs in one letter.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> However,
so much is plain that Cassiodorus ascribed to St Jerome
a work of this kind. Finally, it must be borne in mind
that St Jerome had translated some of the historical
writings of Eusebius. This may have given rise to the
idea that he had also translated his collection of the
martyrdoms. It is not impossible that he may have
done so, although we have no evidence of the fact. Bede
also speaks of a martyrology of St Jerome, but with
some uncertainty, for he had never seen it himself, and
thought St Jerome may have been only the translator
and not the author of the work.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> In Bede’s day the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
so-called <i>Hieronymianum</i> was already in existence, as
the researches of De Rossi and Duchesne have recently
shown. That it was also known to Gregory the Great
and Cassiodorus cannot be maintained, especially as
the words of the latter are so obscure. It is, however,
certain from his words that Cassiodorus believed Jerome
to have been the author of a work of this kind. Further
evidence for this is, unfortunately, lacking, though the
thing is not impossible in itself. Abbot Hilduin, a
writer of the ninth century, referred also to this point,
and was of opinion that Constantine had collected all
the acts of the martyrs from all parts of the empire,
and had sent them to Eusebius at Cæsarea.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> This
statement, however, is not of much importance, since it
represents a view originating in the interpolated letter
of St Jerome already referred to.</p>

<p>However this may be, there have existed since the
eighth century numerous MSS. of a collection of the
names of the martyrs of all times and countries belonging
to the Roman Empire which went by the name of
the <i>Martyrologium Hieronymianum</i>, and to which was
attached two reputed letters of St Jerome to Chromatius,
Bishop of Aquileia, and to Heliodorus, Bishop of
Altinum. The work corresponds to that mentioned
by Cassiodorus.</p>

<p>Upon close examination, it is quite clear that the work,
as we have it now, cannot have been composed by St
Jerome. It includes the names of many persons who
lived at a date subsequent to St Jerome, as, for example,
to name one out of many, St Gregory the Great on the
12th March. In other respect the names do not extend
beyond the seventh century, as appears upon an inspection
of the earliest codices. In later recensions we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
naturally meet with the names of many persons who
lived at a still later date.</p>

<p>As regards the date of composition, the personality
of the compiler and kindred questions, we are face to
face with an historical and literary problem resembling
that of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals and the Donation
of Constantine. Still some light has now been
cast upon these difficulties, since we have at last a
thoroughly critical text of the document, the investigations
of De Rossi and Duchesne having determined
which of the existing MSS. is the earliest.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>Among the MSS. belonging to the eighth century, is
one written for the Monastery of Weissenburg in the
diocese of Spires, now preserved in Wolfenbüttel,
<i>Codex Wisseniburgensis</i>, 23. De Rossi believed it was
written shortly before the death of Abbot Wando († 756)
of Fontanelle in the diocese of Rouen, because his
death has been added by a later hand on <i>XV. Kal.
Mai</i>. It is certain that the codex was written
before 772, because this date is referred to in it.
Of about the same period is the Parisian Codex 10
837, belonging to Echternach. It is written in an
Anglo-Saxon hand, and is perhaps somewhat later than
the former, but is derived from an original MS. certainly
older than the Weissenburg Codex. This view
which is that of De Rossi gains support from the
fact that the two festivals in honour of the Holy
Cross are not contained in the codex, while they
appear in the Weissenburg and all later codices. Both
codices are full of errors of grammar and spelling.
The codex from the monastery of Hilariacum originally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
belonging to Metz and now at Berne, is more correct
and better written, but unfortunately only extends to
the 21st November. The latest entries made in it by the
first hand belong to the year 766 and refer to Bishop
Chrodegang. The text dates from the time of Clotaire
II. (584-628).</p>

<p>These three most ancient recensions do not differ
from one another to any great extent, but the MSS.
belonging to later times, when the work was often copied
and used, show much greater divergencies, for alterations
and additions were continually being made in it
corresponding to the requirements of the local churches
and monasteries where it was employed.</p>

<p>Since the two learned editors have succeeded in
detecting the original matter common to the three
recensions, we are in possession of the following result:
the martyrology which formed the original source of all
later texts as far as they are known to us was written in
Auxerre between 592 and 600. The grounds for this conclusion
are briefly as follows: the compiler is evidently
well informed as to ecclesiastical and secular events in
Gaul, in fact far better than with regard to any other
country. In naming the cities of Gaul, he gives the provinces
in which they are situated, and gives also many
unusual details respecting the individuals named, as for
example when he gives in the case of bishops, not only
the day on which they died, but the date of their ordinations
as well; the names are also always given correctly,
while in other documents they are often frightfully distorted.
A circumstance which especially points to Auxerre
as the locality from which the martyrology originated
is that this not very important city is mentioned thirty
times while the neighbouring and much larger city of
Lyons is named only twenty-six times. Moreover, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
the bishops of Auxerre, with one solitary exception, are
named, while there are many gaps in the lists of the
bishops of Lyons and Autun. Thirdly, a <i>litania</i> is
enjoined on the first of each month, and this custom
was peculiar to the Church of Auxerre, having just been
introduced at that time by Bishop Aunarius. Again,
the day of the ordination of this not very famous
Bishop Aunarius is marked (II. Kal. Aug.), but not as
we might have expected the day of his death. The
same holds good of Syagrius, Bishop of Autun; the
date of his consecration (natale suscepti episcopatus)
is given, but not the date of his death which happened
in 599 or 600. The last Gallic bishop whose death is
noticed is Avitus of Clermont († 592).</p>

<p>On account of these facts, Duchesne arrived at the
conclusion that the so-called <i>Martyrologium Hieronymianum</i>
originated at Auxerre between 592 and 600.
This conclusion is not weakened by the fact that personages
belonging to the seventh century are included,<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
such as Desiderius of Vienne († 606-7), Columbanus
(† 615), Eustasius, Abbot of Luxeuil († 629), and Abbot
Attala, the date of whose death is unknown. Desiderius,
indeed, appears in the Berne and Weissenburg Codices,
and the three others in that of Echternach, but they
have been added by the transcribers, and both De
Rossi and Duchesne are agreed that none of these
codices represent the original text composed at
Auxerre.</p>

<p>The editors go yet further, and show that the compiler
was also very well informed concerning ecclesiastical
matters in Italy, especially in Northern Italy and Milan;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
while he has comparatively little to say about Spain,
Rhætia, Dalmatia, Pannonia, and nothing at all about
Scotto-Irish saints. This postulates the existence of
a yet older work, used by the compiler of Auxerre,
which may have been identical with the work familiar
to Cassiodorus.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> This document, however, has entirely
disappeared without leaving behind it any other documents
derived from it. If one follows the perspective
thus opened out, the connecting links may finally come
to light which connect this document with the work of
Eusebius, referred to by Eulogius of Alexandria and in
the two letters attributed to St Jerome.</p>

<p>However, we shall not follow these interesting suggestions
further, but shall content ourselves with the fact
that in the <i>Hieronymianum</i>, in the earliest form in which
it has come down to us, we have a primitive martyrology,<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>
with additions and alterations made to it by a Frankish
transcriber or compiler between 592-600. In its original
form it contained only saints belonging to the Græco-Roman
empire, and this accounts for the absence of the
Irish saints and those of Mesopotamia. Thus at last the
so-called <i>Hieronymianum</i> has been made serviceable
for use in historical and liturgical investigations; the
learned editors, in giving us as far as possible the original
text, have given us for the first time a reliable edition
of the document, and the Bollandists have rendered
the work still more serviceable by the addition of a
reliable alphabetical index, thus considerably lightening
the labours of those who use this work. This is no
common gain for liturgical study, since the <i>Hieronymianum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
obtained in the course of time, an increasingly
prominent position, more prominent indeed at last than
it deserved; moreover it has not been without its
influence upon later martyrologies and calendars, and
has had an appreciable effect even on the development
of the Church’s cycle of festivals.</p>

<p>To know the number and condition of the Christians
who had laid down their lives for the faith within the
limits of the Roman empire would be of the highest
interest now and always; to record the name, date,
and locality of each with statistical accuracy would have
been a work deserving the thanks of posterity. It
might have been done immediately after the cessation
of the Diocletian persecution, but only with the assistance
of the secular authorities. Eulogius and the
writer of the letters ascribed to St Jerome were on the
right track in thinking that Eusebius had undertaken
to furnish a work of this character with the assistance
of the emperor; the latter informs us that Eusebius
actually did so, and that the collection contained the
names of from five to eight hundred martyrs for every
day of the year, thus giving a total of between 182,500
and 292,000 martyrs.</p>

<p>Our Latin compiler indeed has not brought together
so many names, and he states in the reputed letter of
St Jerome that he only admitted those martyrs whose
commemoration was celebrated with special solemnity
(qui sunt in amplissima festivitate). However he
has brought together in round numbers 6000 names—quite
a respectable number when compared with
the <i>Menologium Basilianum</i>, which belongs to a much
later date, and it remains a question how it was
possible for a Frankish scholar of the sixth century
to get together so many names. Some of them certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
are distorted, others are repeated in a remarkable
way, and others again have an unreal sound,<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> but
when all deductions have been made, there still remains
so much that is historical and unexceptional that the
whole work cannot be dismissed as devoid of all
authority. With regard to the origin and value of this
mass of names, one finds oneself confronted by a question
which seems equally insoluble, whether the compiler
was a native of Gaul, of North Italy, or of anywhere
else. He certainly incorporated into his martyrology
the older lists of martyrs existing at his day, many
of which are known to us, and the two editors have
displayed both industry and insight in making this
clear in several cases; yet all these lists of martyrs
taken together contain scarcely a thousand names.
From what sources has the compiler obtained the rest?
This is the question which still awaits an answer.
On the other hand the compiler has given expression
to an important principle to which is due his influence
on the hagiology and liturgy of later ages. The Arian
Calendar of which we have spoken, concerned itself
with the eastern half alone of the empire, and is composed
almost entirely of names belonging thereto, but the
author of the <i>Hieronymianum</i> set to work on quite
another principle; he had in view the entire Christian
world, East and West, Africa and Gaul. His point of
view is infinitely wider than that of his predecessors,
and even of many of his successors, and he made use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
of the fruitful principle of universalism, rejecting all
particularism in the ecclesiastical sphere.</p>

<p>While there had been calendars in the West containing
the names of martyrs belonging to a particular
diocese or country, the compiler of the <i>Hieronymianum</i>
regarded the Church as a whole—as catholic. The
meaning of this will be seen from a glance at the
service-books, the sacramentaries especially. In the
ninth century and later, the Roman sacramentaries,
even those intended for use in other countries such as
those of St Gall, Mainz, Cologne, and Essen, contain
only Masses for the Roman saints, confining themselves
to one or two local saints in the supplement.
The principle of universality only very gradually
affected the formularies of the Mass, and did not reach
its full expression until the sixteenth century, but
it came to the fore much earlier in the martyrologies,
as early indeed as Ado, Usuardus, Notker, and Rabanus
Maurus, chiefly owing to the influence of the <i>Hieronymianum</i>.</p>

<p>This document is not without peculiarities of its own.
In all recensions of the text, the 25th March is given
as the day of Christ’s death, and since James the Lord’s
brother, here called also “The Just,” died at Easter,
his death is placed also on the 25th March. In the
Berne Codex the sacrifice of Isaac is commemorated on
the same day. There is a goodly array of Old Testament
names, <i>e.g.</i> Aggeus, Habacuc, Job, Joel, Aaron,
Eliseus, etc. In the Berne Codex, the 28th September
is given as the day of Noe’s going out of the ark, the 7th
January as the day of the Exodus, and the 1st May as
the commencement of our Lord’s preaching.</p>

<p>Now that the date of its composition has been fixed,
the <i>Hieronymianum</i> is specially valuable for the information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
which it gives concerning Frankish hagiography
and its gradual development. Whoever will
devote himself in the future to investigating St Denys
of Paris, St Ursula, etc., must pursue his studies in the
various recensions and transcriptions of the <i>Hieronymianum</i>.
It will well repay the trouble, if someone
would investigate how many of the reputed martyrs
of Lower Germany are named in this important document.
It only knows of two martyrs at Cologne,
Asclinius and Pamphilus, in addition to the Moorish
martyrs whose numbers, however, vary greatly in the
MSS.; their commander is named Gereon. No saints
are given for Mainz. For Treves we have Valerius,
Paulinus, Maximinus, and a Bishop Militius; Palmatius
Thyrsus and his Innumerable Company had not yet
been discovered or invented. For Bonn the connection
in which Cassius, Florentius, and Mallusius stand to
one another on the 10th October is worthy of notice.
We find some African martyrs first of all on this day,
and then, without indication of Bonn or any other
locality, we have: “Et alibi Cassi, Eusebi, Florenti,
Victoris, Agrippinæ, Mallusi cum alii trecentos xxx.”
(<i>sic</i>). The later legends omit Eusebius, and put
Mallusius instead, who was buried at Birten and discovered
by Bishop Evergisil; the martyr Victor is
said to have been also originally buried at Birten.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the Roman martyrs and the succession
of the popes, the <i>Hieronymianum</i> is not altogether
independent of the Philocalian list, although it is fuller.
The earliest pope mentioned in it is Cornelius, and the
last St Leo I., while the Philocalian list begins with
Lucius († 254), and ends with Boniface I. († 422). The
<i>Hieronymianum</i> gives also the days of the consecration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
of some of them, <i>e.g.</i> Miltiades, Liberius, Innocent I.,
and Boniface I. On the other hand the earlier martyrs
are omitted with the exception of Clement I.</p>

<p>The indications of place are dealt with on various
principles. For the most part the city is naturally
given where the martyrdom took place; occasionally
only the province is given, as, for example, Achaia,
Asia, Campania, Sardinia, and Sicily, this being especially
the case in regard to the last-named island.
Remarkable on account of its vagueness is the phrase
<i>in Africa</i> which occurs more than a hundred times
without the name of any town being given, but, nevertheless,
in the case of many African martyrs the town is
given.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> Often so many personal names follow one another
that one suspects that some indications of place
have dropped out, a conjecture to which one is all the
more inclined as the indefinite expression <i>et alibi</i> is very
often employed.</p>

<p>The martyrs themselves are only distinguished by
their rank in the hierarchy, when they belonged to the
sacred ministry, <i>i.e.</i> deacon, presbyter, bishop, but
by far the larger number of personages are without any
indication of place, date, etc. In many cases it is
evident that the same person has been entered twice
or oftener,<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> and mutilations, disfigurements and alterations
are very numerous, more especially in the later
MSS. The transcribers allowed themselves considerable
freedom, adding supplements and corrections,
apart from the unintentional mistakes they made.
A hint of a literary nature is given by the remark,
“cujus” or “quorum acta habentur,” indicating the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
existence of the acts of such and such a martyr. Later
transcribers were not satisfied with this, but, when the
acts were forthcoming, added larger or shorter notices
from them to the text.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Had we the work as it came
originally from the hands of the compiler of Auxerre,
these imperfections would disappear to a considerable
extent. A glance at any entry in the three recensions
shows how freely the earliest transcribers dealt with
the original text; in the new edition the three recensions
are printed in parallel columns.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> All these
remarks have an intimate bearing upon the question
of the sources and origin of the work. With regard to
sources, the Roman <i>Depositio Martyrum</i> has been incorporated
bodily, and a great part of the Carthaginian
Calendar as well, but the compiler must have had the
Arian Martyrology in a better copy than that which
has come down to us, or even in its original form; this
is shown by the fact that frequently he has quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
correctly enlarged some of its indefinite entries.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> His
use of this martyrology is clear from his inserting
Eusebius among the saints, in ignorance of his Arianism;
he inserted the name in all simplicity, a mistake
avoided by the Greek menologies, and the same may
possibly have been the case with regard to Arius in the
Weissenburg Codex.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p>This employment of earlier sources coupled with
the numerous correct entries in the <i>Hieronymianum</i>
entirely excludes the view that the document is a
fabrication. Indeed its composition can safely be said
to have come about in the following manner:—in the two
first centuries the persecutions were on the whole local,
and the number of martyrs not very large, although
the persecution at Lyons in 177 caused the death of
more than forty martyrs, not counting confessors;
a change took place in the third century, when persecutions
were commanded by the emperors for the whole
extent of the empire, and, under Diocletian, the martyrs
were to be reckoned, if not by millions, at least by thousands.
At the conclusion of the persecutions, it must
have occurred to many to ask how many had lost their
lives in this troublous period, and the idea of drawing
up statistics of the martyrdoms must have sprung up.
We have no evidence of anything of this sort actually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
having been done, but in the sixth century there was
a widespread opinion that a work of this kind had been
accomplished by Eusebius under Constantine, and
the passages quoted from Cassiodorus and Gregory
the Great show it was believed a list of the martyrs for
the whole year existed in Italy or in Rome. If this
work contained merely a list of names and dates, its
interest must have been merely statistical and in no
wise scientific, since little could be learnt from the
names by themselves. In the seventh century, however,
either in Auxerre or in North Italy, it seems to have
been held in greater esteem; it found a transcriber and
reviser, and finally was brought into connection with the
liturgy owing to its being read at the choir-offices in
monasteries and convents, and by this means, it won its
way to a position of widespread importance, which,
however, did not have an advantageous effect on the
purity of the text.</p>

<p>With regard to the printed editions, there are several
published by various scholars who relied upon late MSS.
of little value. We may mention the editions of
Fiorentini, Lucca 1668 (incomplete), of D’Achery in
the <i>Spicilegium</i>, ii. 1 (Migne, xxx.), and of Galesinius,
Milan, 1577. It used to be disputed which of these
editions gave the earliest text, but they are all quite
superseded now. There are also many abstracts of the
<i>Hieronymianum</i> in mediæval handwriting, as, for example,
the <i>Martyrol. Gallicanum</i>; Martène, <i>Ampliss.
Coll. VI.</i>, called after Chauvelin (Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>, xxx.
607); the <i>Fuldense</i>; <i>Anal. Boll. XIII.</i>; the Reichenau
martyrology, etc., but they are of small scientific importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span></p>

<h3>5. <i>The Lectionary and Martyrology of Silos</i></h3>

<p>Since the appointment of special Masses in honour of
the saints is a distinguishing feature of the Latin rite,
Western liturgical books are in themselves a source
from which we can increase our knowledge of the saints’
festivals, the most important in this respect being the
sacramentaries, but the other books used at the celebration
of Mass, the collections of epistles and gospels
especially, also throw light on the subject.</p>

<p>In addition to the books of this kind already named,
the <i>Lectionarius</i> of Silos has, in recent times, attracted
much attention in this connection.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> It is of the highest
importance both for the history of the development of
the ecclesiastical year and for the festivals of the saints,
for as it belongs to the period preceding the Carolingian
liturgical reform, it represents a very ancient rite of
which, until its discovery, all trace had disappeared.
This rite is not the same as the southern Spanish rite of
the Province of Boetica from which the so-called
Mozarabic rite is derived, but belongs to the ancient
ecclesiastical province of Toledo. The codex in
which it is contained was written before the year
1062, for a later event, <i>i.e.</i> the translation of St
Isidore’s relics from Seville to Leon, is added by a
later hand. This codex, originally belonging to the
monastery of St Sebastian at Silos and now in the
National library of Paris, contains two distinct documents,
a lectionary giving the lections from scripture
for the whole of the year, and a martyrology; the
latter was compiled between 925 and 1000; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
lectionary much earlier. Its antiquity is proved:
(1) By the limited numbers of saints’ days; (2) by
the circumstance that the catechumenate is still in
force; (3) that the Saturdays in Lent are not fast
days, agreeing with the eastern custom; (4) the Sundays
after Epiphany and Pentecost do not appear
as forming part of the ecclesiastical year, and are
not even numbered, but, as in the <i>Gelasianum</i>, there
are added twenty-four Masses called “dominicæ
quotidianæ”; (5) there are five Sundays in Advent;
(6) with regard to saints’ days, Anastasius the Persian
is not yet placed along with St Vincent on the 21st
January, and the Apostle James is also omitted along
with all reference to the Spanish legend connected with
his name. From this it is plain that St James, at the
time when this work was compiled enjoyed no special
worship in Spain. On these grounds the first editor,
G. Morin, regards the lectionary as certainly belonging
to 650.</p>

<p>The book represents a rite hitherto entirely unknown
but which can be no other than the ancient rite of
Toledo, since in it the Annunciation is placed on the
18th December as is prescribed by the first canon of the
tenth council of Toledo. It differs from the Mozarabic
rite as to the number of Sundays in Advent, of which
the latter reckons six, and also in the eight Masses for
the Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost; another
peculiarity is that the Innocents’ Day is omitted on the
27th December, but an “Allisio Infantium” is kept
instead in the 8th January. None of the Roman and
Byzantine feasts of our Lady are mentioned, and only
one feast of the Holy Cross on the 3rd May, omitting
the other on the 14th September; all Masses for saints’
days have two epistles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span></p>

<p>The martyrology of Silos also is an important document
on account of its original character, although it is
some three centuries later than the lectionary. It is
entitled, <i>Martyrum Legium</i>, and it is considerably richer
in names of saints than the lectionary, and is quite
independent of the <i>Hieronymianum</i>, though influenced
in a slight degree by the Roman rite. The martyrs in
the Moorish persecution, under, Abdurrhaman II., which
lasted from 850 to 860, appear in large numbers. The
historian of this persecution, the priest Eugenius of
Toledo, who was put to death on 11th March 859, is
entered, but placed on 1st June, the day of the translation
of his relics; St Pelagius of Corduba, who suffered
death on 26th June 925 under Abdurrhaman III. is
also entered, and this date gives one limit in fixing the
date of the work, the other limit being the year 1000.
There are five additions by a later hand, <i>i.e.</i> on 12th
March, <i>Gregorii Papæ</i>; on 1st May, <i>Transitus Philippi
Apostoli</i>, without St James; on 28th April, <i>Prudentii
et Sociorum ejus</i>; on 21st December, <i>S. Thomæ Apostoli</i>,
and on 22nd December the <i>Translatio corporis S. Isidori</i>.
Some personages are entered, who are not called saints,
but only <i>Domnus</i>, four of whom belong to Toledo, two
being bishops: Julian († 6th March 690) and Eugenius II.
(† 29th May 647); on 14th January, another Julian, and,
on 13th March, <i>Depositio Leandri</i>. Half of the entire
names belong to Spain, the other half to Rome and the
East; of the Frankish martyrs, Denys of Paris, Afra of
Augsburg, and Boniface of Mainz are commemorated.
As regards the feasts of our Lady, besides the ancient
Spanish feast on the 18th December, we have only the
Assumption on 15th August. Litanies are appointed
for 10th September, 7th November, and 15th December,
besides a fast on 2nd January. The name of the Apostle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
St James is absent from the martyrology as well as from
the lectionary. Bishop Torquatus and his companions
are placed on 1st May, in both documents, but in the
martyrology they are not described as disciples of the
apostles, which is favourable to their historical existence.
The Apostles Simon and Jude are on the 1st July instead
of the 28th October, and there is also a <i>Symon
Apostolus</i> on 19th October as well. Although traces
of later influence appear in this martyrology, it has
still preserved the independent character of the early
Christian Calendars.</p>

<h3>6. <i>Egyptian (Coptic) Calendars and Synaxaria</i></h3>

<p>The anglican archeologist, John Selden († 1634), has
given us the earliest Egyptian calendars in his work
on the Jewish Sanhedrin which was left unfinished when
he died. In the third book of this work, Selden intended
to deal with the rite for the dedication of Christian
churches, although this lay beyond the immediate
purpose of his investigations, and he thought that some
Arabic Calendars in his possession might have some
bearing on the question.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Unfortunately, he gave no
information concerning the MSS. from which these
calendars were taken, and they seem, moreover, when
discovered, to have been by no means in a good condition.
Ludolf declared himself dissatisfied with these publications,
and Wüstenfeld remarked: “The Arabic MSS.
employed, must have been faulty, and were made still
worse by the faulty reading and transcribing of the
editor and the printing is so incorrect that some words
would be almost, and others quite unintelligible, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
there not other helps to their meaning at hand.”<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>
Still, in spite of these well-founded criticisms from
specialists, Selden’s work cannot be over-looked. There
seem also to have been gaps and undecipherable passages
in the MS. itself.</p>

<p>There are three calendars edited by Selden: two
short, and one long, the latter being of later date than
the others. The two first have a supplement to each
month, called <i>ordo alter</i>, both appear to have been
originally drawn up for the use of monasteries, but are
distinguished from one another in important points.
We shall designate them by the letters A and B. A
is at any rate of Egyptian origin and is monophysite
in character, because the heresiarch Severus, who lived
in the sixth century, twice appears in it, on 8th February
and 29th September. Other peculiarities in the document
are: 1. It has two feasts of the Holy Cross, on
6th March <i>Inventio Crucis</i>, by which doubtless the recovery
of the Cross by Heraclius in 629 is meant, and
<i>festum crucis gloriosæ</i> on 14th September. 2. The
Nativity of our Lady is on 26th April. 3. The commemorations
of the Mother of God in use in Egypt, are
given on the 21st of the months January, March, May,
July, and October: B omits these feasts. 4. A has
the archangel Gabriel on the 18th December, but no
festival of the Annunciation, while B places <i>Evangelismus</i>
on the 25th March, and no feast on the 18th December
pointing onwards to the impending Nativity of our
Lord. 5. A has the four living creatures of the
Apocalypse on the 4th November who appear also
later on in Coptic calendars: B omits them. 6. In A
the conquest of Egypt by the Mahometans is seven
times mentioned, <i>e.g.</i> 26th May, 10th December, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
7. A does not mention St Ignatius of Antioch, but B
places him on the 20th December. 8. B has the
Emperor Theodosius on the 3rd March, St John
Chrysostom on the 7th May and 13th November, also
Ephrem Syrus on the 9th July, and Dioscorus of Alexandria
on the 31st August.</p>

<p>From these entries we see that B is catholic and
Syrian, and A monophysite and Egyptian. Both
certainly belong to the same period. B was probably
also used in Egypt, for the Patriarch Isaac I. of
Alexandria is mentioned, who died on the 10th Athyr
= 6th November 688 or 689.<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> The Athanasius mentioned
on the 6th September must have been Athanasius II.
who became patriarch of Antioch in 629.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> These
calendars and the following one as well are contained
in the Arabic translation of Abulaibsan Achmed
Calcasendi who has prefaced them with a list of Coptic
festivals (see above <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>). Had they come down
to us in better condition, they would be of the
utmost importance in the investigation of our
subject, notwithstanding their heretical character.
The third of the calendars published by Selden has
fared little better; it certainly belongs to the same
period as the others, although somewhat later in date.
The latest person mentioned in it seems to be the
Patriarch Isaac I., named already in A. It was thought
that this was the second monophysite patriarch of that
name who died in 954, but it is not so, for this personage
is named on the 10th Athyr = 6th November, and
the Coptic Synaxarium, translated by Wüstenfeld, which
mentions him on the same day, expressly states that he
was the immediate successor of John, surnamed
Semnudæus from the place of his birth, Sebennytos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
who died on the 9th Athyr 686, after having pointed
him out as his successor. The predecessor of Isaac II.,
however, was Sophronius, and his successor was called
Job. Accordingly Isaac I. must be intended here,
and thus the calendar belongs to the end of the seventh
or the beginning of the eighth century.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>Its monophysite character is proved from the mention
of the heresiarch Severus three times, <i>i.e.</i> on the 26th
April (<i>festum Severi</i>), on the 4th September, and on the
1st December. It has no feast of St Peter and St Paul
on the 29th June, but only a <i>Planctus Pauli</i> on the
18th March. The following points are worthy of
notice:—25th March is the day of the Crucifixion,
the 28th May is kept as the <i>Inventio ossium
S. Lucæ</i> and the 6th March as the <i>Manifestatio
Crucis</i>, where the later calendar adds, <i>per
Heraclium imperatorem</i>. We have the beginnings of
the Egyptian custom of commemorating the Mother of
God on the 21st of each month, <i>i.e.</i> on the 21st Payni
and the 21st Phaophi. The <i>festum Dominæ</i> on the 2nd
August is certainly a feast of our Lady, but the <i>festum
Mirjam</i> on the 22nd July is probably a festival of St
Mary Magdalen. There are many things in this document
the meaning of which can only be surmised.</p>

<p>A welcome addition to our knowledge of liturgical
matters among the Copts exists in a calendar of the
ninth century in the Vatican library; it is found
along with a Coptic <i>Evangeliarium</i> in a codex written
in 1328. The document is described and translated
into Latin by A. Mai in the fourth volume of his
<i>Nova Collectio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> The date is determined by the fact
that the Patriarch Amba Zacharias, who is entered as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
a saint in the later Synaxarium on the 13th Athyr,<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>
does not appear in the calendar; he was patriarch,
according to Le Quien from 1005 to 1032. The last
Jacobite patriarchs mentioned are those who succeeded
one another from Alexander to Michael (Chail).
Michael was succeeded by John, after a vacancy of ten
years, who ruled from 766-799.<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Accordingly this
calendar belongs to the ninth century. A striking
peculiarity in it is that the <i>Manifestatio Crucis</i> is on the
17th-19th September instead of the 14th as in all other
calendars.</p>

<p>The circumstance that several saints, instead of
having one commemoration, have several, may give
rise to confusion. St Thecla appears no less than five
times, twice with the title martyr (on the 25th February
and the 10th September), once as <i>apostola</i> (on the 12th
July), on the 6th May and 3rd December she has no
title. Although there was a second St Thecla, still this
would not altogether explain the entries. Then James
the son of Zebedee is mentioned on the 28th and 30th
of April, as well as James the Lord’s brother on the
12th July and 23rd October. St Michael the Archangel
occurs eight times. Our Lady’s Nativity is celebrated
on both the 26th April and the 7th September. No
importance is to be attached to these repetitions; they
are purely arbitrary, and are due to the desire to provide
a name for every day in the calendar, and to fill up
vacant places.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> This appears especially from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
circumstance that on the 29th of every Egyptian month,
corresponding to the 25th in the Julian Calendar, a
commemoration of Christ’s Nativity is given, and on the
21st of each month a feast of our Lady (Commemoratio
Dominæ S. Mariæ). The Death and Assumption of
our Lady is placed on the 16th January. St Joseph
the Carpenter has his commemoration on the 20th July.
Fides, Spes, and Charitas appear as three martyrs
under Hadrian on the 25th January; they are said to
be daughters of a reported Sophia. No St Catherine
appears either in this calendar or in the later <i>Synaxarium</i>
but the heretic Severus († 539) is twice commemorated:
on the 29th September (<i>Adventus Severi Patrarchæ
in Ægyptum</i>) and on the 8th February, when he died.</p>

<p>Coptic calendars of a later date are still richer in names,
but are full of legends and absurdities which show the
steady decline of culture among the sect under
Mahometan rule. This is especially the case with the
<i>Synaxarium</i> or collection of legends compiled from
ancient sources by Bishop Amba Michael of Atriba and
Malidsch at the end of the fourteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> The
basis of the collection is an older work of the same kind
composed sometime about the year 1090 (see 3rd
Athyr).<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Information concerning the saints who lived
in monasteries was taken by Bishop Michael from a
so-called “Guide,” used by both the Egyptian Copts
and Melchites.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> A “Guide” of this kind had been
written especially for Alexandria by Bishop Amba
John of Kift. Michael refers in his work to the years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
1382 and 1387 (see 7th Bermahat and 19th Bermuda),
and so must have lived in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>As the work contains much information drawn from
the ecclesiastical histories of the Copts and Abyssinians,
it has been translated and much used in spite of its
faulty character. It affords many useful particulars
concerning the traditions and feasts of the Egyptian
Church, and on this account Stephen Assemani undertook
to make an abstract of the whole work which is
printed in the fourth volume of Mai’s <i>Nova Collectio</i>.
F. Wüstenfeld made a translation of the first part containing
the first half of the Egyptian year, from
September to February; the second half, from March
to August including the intercalary days, is unfortunately
still untranslated.</p>

<h3>7. <i>The Menology of Constantinople (Eighth Century)</i></h3>

<p>The Eastern Church possesses a calendar of Saints
belonging to the eighth century, which occupies an intermediate
position between a merely Eastern Calendar,
and one that is universal. Its title runs, Calendar of
the Gospels for Festivals (μηνολόγιον τῶν εὐαγγελίων
ἑορταστικῶν), for it gives the passage from the Gospels
to be read on each day; it contains a considerable
number of saints belonging to the East, though the days
are far from being all occupied. March and April
have remarkably few feasts; this is owing to the
ancient, but even then obsolete injunction of the
Trullan Council that the feasts of no martyrs were to be
kept in Lent.</p>

<p>Several circumstances prove that Constantinople was
the locality where this document originated and was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
use. Certain quarters of the city, as for example,
Blachernæ and Chalcoprateia, are mentioned; the
11th May is mentioned as the day of the city’s foundation;
so too is the earthquake which threw down the
city walls on the 24th September 557. A large number
of the patriarchs of Constantinople are included, twenty-nine
in all, beginning with Metrophanes (4th June
305-325) and ending with Paul who was patriarch from
September 686 to the 2nd September 693. The absence
of the twenty-one reputed bishops from St Andrew to
Metrophanes suggests the thought that when this
document was drawn up this invention had not been
accepted.</p>

<p>Morcelli maintains that the Paul the younger mentioned
on the 2nd September is the Patriarch Paul II.,
under whom the Trullan Council was held in 692, but he
would, however, exonerate him from participation in the
schismatic council, since he opposed it at a later date;
this, however, contradicts the accepted chronology. No
patriarch, not even Germanus, and none of the many
martyrs and confessors belonging to the time of the
Iconoclastic controversy under Leo the Isaurian and
Constantine Copronymus, are mentioned. From this
one concludes that the menology was composed immediately
after the cessation of the first Iconoclastic
controversy, at a date when the judgment on the
sanctity of these personages had not yet been concluded,
or when people were unwilling to revive the painful
recollections which their name evoked.</p>

<p>The martyrs, confessors, and doctors of the Eastern
Church are there in long array, at least all the celebrated
ones, not only those belonging to all four patriarchates,
but also those belonging to other countries, such as
Anastasius the Persian († 628, on the 22nd January).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
The popes and saints of the West are excluded with the
exception of the three martyrs Lawrence, Gervasius,
and Protasius.</p>

<p>The names of many Old Testament personages are
included: Moses, Aaron, Elias, Jeremias, etc., also
almost all the apostles and their immediate disciples,
but for the most part they occur on different dates from
those which they usually occupy in the Roman
Calendar. For instance, St John the Evangelist is on
the 8th May and the 26th September, St Barnabas on
the 11th June, SS. Peter and Paul on the 29th June,
St Titus on the 25th August, St Thomas on the 6th
October, St Philip on the 14th November, St Andrew
on the 30th November. SS. Joachim and Anna appear
on the 9th September, the day after our Lady’s
Nativity, the Archangel Michael on the 8th November,
St Thecla (here entitled proto-martyr) on the 24th
September, and the Holy Innocents on the 31st
December. For the first time, Constantine and his
mother Helena, appear as saints in the calendar; they
are commemorated together on the 21st May, a day
which falls before that on which Constantine actually
died. Justinian and his consort Theodora are commemorated
also, but do not appear with the title
“saint”; they are placed on the 14th November, the
day on which Justinian died, Theodora having preceded
him on the 28th June 548. Justinian was called a
prince of pious memory by the popes Pelagius II. and
Gregory the Great.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>From these indications it appears that this martyrology
was intended principally if not exclusively for the
city and diocese of Constantinople. The safest conclusion
to arrive at is to regard it as the martyrology<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
of the patriarchate of Constantinople, since it steers a
middle course, as it were, between particularism and
universality: it is the most ancient of the Greek
menologies known to us. Among the Greeks St John
Damascene is regarded as the originator of calendars
of this kind,<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> corresponding to Ado in the Latin Church.
The menology has been edited with an excellent commentary
by Stephen A. Morcelli (Rome, 1788), having
previously been published in Latin at Urbino (1727) from
the Codex of Cardinal Albani.</p>

<h3>8. <i>The Menology of the Emperor Basil II., and the
Syrian Lectionary of the Eleventh Century</i></h3>

<p>This menology takes its name from Basil II. <i>Porphyrogenitus</i>
(976-1025), and was given to the public
for the first time in its entirety by Cardinal Albani at
Urbino in 1727, from two codices each containing six
months. It is distinguished from the menology which
we have just described by having a saint on every day
of the year, and most of the days have more than one;
the saints are drawn from the whole extent of the
Eastern Church, and the Western Church, especially
Sicily and Rome, is more prominent than in the former
document.</p>

<p>As regards Rome, there are a large number of popes
given who are entirely absent from the other menology:
Silvester, Leo, Agatho, Gregory I., Celestine, etc. With
the exception of Gregory I. they are generally placed
on different dates from those on which they are commemorated
in the West, <i>e.g.</i> Silvester on the 2nd
January, Leo on the 18th February, and Alexander on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
the 16th March, etc. It appears as if the sources which
the compiler had at his disposal for the West were insufficient,
since, for example, he gives St Perpetua, St
Felicitas and companions once on the 2nd February,
and again on the 14th March, with the addition, “in
Rome”; from this it would appear that he thought
the saints mentioned on the first date had belonged to
some other locality. St Agnes is given on the 5th July.</p>

<p>Not so many patriarchs of Constantinople are given
as one would have expected, and many, indeed, are
omitted who are included in the menology of which we
have spoken in the previous section, as, for example,
Nectarius, Paul II., Gennadius, Thomas II., but on the
other hand we find some who lived after the composition
of the earlier document, especially Germanus,
Tarasius, and Antonius II., surnamed Cauleas († 12th
February 896).<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p>In other points the <i>Basilianum</i> resembles the former
work, except that it is fuller in every respect. The
most striking feature is the large number of saints
belonging to religious orders contained in it, who for
the most part are specially designated; even the
patriarch of the Western monks, St Benedict, is not
forgotten, and is given on his proper day. Names from
the Old Testament occur frequently, and from the New
Testament, we have almost all the disciples of the
apostles whose names are given, and these are designated
as “belonging to the Seventy.” The number of the
days of apostles is considerable, though seldom coinciding
with the days observed in the Western Church,
except in the case of St Mark, St Barnabas, SS. Peter
and Paul, and St Andrew. Both the St James
are absent, and so are deprived of veneration within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
the region in which this document was followed,<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> but
there is a feast of all the apostles on the 30th June.
St Anna appears on the 25th July; St John the Baptist
on the 24th June and 29th August. It is to be noticed
that the first four general councils have each a special
day allotted to them, while in the <i>Constantinopolitanum</i>
all are commemorated on the same day—16th July.
It is strange to find not only earthquakes, included,
but also defeats in the wars with the Persians, Arabs,
and Bulgarians, but unfortunately there is nothing
to indicate the localities where these events happened
(see the 7th and 20th February, the 23rd March, the
24th May, etc.). This exceeds the limits observed in
liturgical documents.</p>

<p>As the day of the foundation of Constantinople (the
11th May) is again included in this document, we must
conclude that it belongs to this city. Since, too, Goths
and Persians find a place in it, it is ahead of its predecessors
in its attempts to achieve universality.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>While the admission of foreign names is to be welcomed
as a step in advance, it may yet, on the other hand, be
a source of confusion and give rise to mistakes later on.
We find, namely, in this menology, that the names of
foreign saints are not always given on the correct date,
but are arbitrarily placed on other days than those to
which they belonged. Later redactors, when they found
the same name on different dates, may have thought
that different persons were meant, and this may have
been the cause of the repetition of the names of saints.
This shows that in admitting names of new saints,
and the correct day of whose death had not been transmitted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
they acted according to their fancy. This was
the case with regard to the majority of the Seventy
Disciples, many of whom appear here for the first time.
The same must have taken place also with feasts of
our Lord, as when the Flight in Egypt is given on the
26th December, and so placed before the Circumcision
and the Presentation. The admission of foreign names
was left to chance or opinion. Thus, <i>e.g.</i> the Western
saints Ambrose, Martin of Tours, and Hosius are admitted,
but Hilary, Augustine, Jerome, etc., are passed
over.</p>

<p>The impression made by the entire document is that
the principles which were on the whole followed in its
composition were not maintained with sufficient care,
but yielded more than was right to opinion and caprice.
In many cases, too, the necessary knowledge of history,
and a sufficient supply of literary material seems to
have been lacking.</p>

<p>A useful document, especially for saints’ days, is a
lectionary of the orthodox Syrians contained in the
codex xix. of the Vatican Library. It was written in
the monastery of Mar Mussa at Antioch in 1030, and
contains in the first section the lections for the
ecclesiastical year, in the second, those for saints’ days,
beginning with the 1st September as New Year’s Day.
In it are given the martyrs of the Iconoclastic controversy,
several orthodox patriarchs of Constantinople,
Nicephorus († 2nd June 828) being the last; then come
many names from the old Testament, and many feasts
of apostles, the <i>Catenæ Petri</i> on the 16th January being
one of them, four feasts of St John the Baptist, and
six of our Lady. There are no Roman or Western
saints with the exception of St Lawrence. This document
has been published by Count F. Miniscalchi-Errizzo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
under the title <i>Evangeliarium Hierosolymitanum</i>
(2 vols. 4to, Verona, 1682).</p>

<p>In using documents of this kind for purposes of
historical investigation, as for instance in order to
determine the day on which a historical personage died,
the appeal must always be to the local sources. In the
case of saints belonging to the Western Church no
importance must be attached to the fact that the
Easterns may have transferred them to a different day,
and <i>vice versâ</i>, as, for example, in the case of St Ignatius
of Antioch. Where the day is given in some local
source, otherwise deserving of credit, we can be then
certain that it is correct. This must be done with regard
to SS. Peter and Paul, for whom the local sources
give invariably the 29th June, while foreign calendars
give other dates, as we find is the case with Polemius,
Silvius, and the Arian martyrology. The compilers of
these calendars wished to celebrate the Princes of the
Apostles, but, being ignorant of the actual day of their
death, placed them on any day that seemed suitable.
Finally, at a later date the correct date came to the
knowledge of foreign churches, and found its way into
their calendars.</p>

<h3>9. <i>The Kalendarium Marmoreum of Naples</i></h3>

<p>In the ninth century, a time of great activity in matters
relating to hagiography, the Church of Naples undertook
a revision of its calendar, which exhibits noteworthy
peculiarities.</p>

<p>First of all, nearly every day of the year is provided
with the name of a saint, which indicates considerable
care and study. This result was achieved by following
the Eastern custom of admitting Old Testament personages,
although not to the same extent. The grounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
on which the selection was made cannot be discovered,
for we have Abraham on the 9th October, Isaac on
the 17th March, Eliseus on the 28th November, Daniel
on the 17th December, Zacharias on the 13th May, while
other important personages, such as Isaias, etc., are
omitted. We are also reminded of eastern usage by the
commemoration of the council of Ephesus on the 4th
August, and other traces of eastern influence are noticeable
in the admission of a few bishops of Constantinople,
such as Metrophanes, and also of the names of Constantine
(without Helena) on the 21st May, and
Theodosius on the 10th November. With regard to
Metrophanes, the compiler is guilty of a remarkable
oversight; he has placed him once on the right day
(the 4th June), without his title, and again on the 4th
January with his title, “<i>Patr. Const.</i>” The confusion
between the 4th of June and the 4th of January might
easily escape a transcriber, and must have already
existed in the source which the compiler used. In order
not to omit any name the compiler preferred to enter
the same name twice, once with, and once without, its
proper title.</p>

<p>This reminds us that St Mark also occurs twice, on
the 25th April and the 17th May. St Philip is united
to St James on the 1st May (a trace of Roman influence),
and is found again alone on the 14th November. St
Silvester comes on the 31st December and a <i>Depositio
Silvestri P.P.</i>, on the 2nd January; a <i>Jacobus Ap.</i> and
Mattheus on unusual dates, the 15th and 16th November,
other Apostles are on more usual dates, <i>e.g.</i> St Jude is
commemorated on the 21st May. St Bartholomew’s
day (the 25th August) is given wrongly as <i>Nat. Pass.</i>,
being in reality the day of his translation. The names
of Apostles and their disciples are very numerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span></p>

<p>With regard to the worship of the Holy Cross, both
days occur (<i>i.e.</i> the 3rd May and 14th September),
with the title now in use, although formerly, the feast
of the 3rd May was alone observed in the West, and that
of the 14th September in the East. The reason for this
circumstance has been already given in this book.
Bishops of Naples naturally appear frequently; <i>e.g.</i>
Maro (15th June) belongs to the third century, others
belong to the period from the sixth to the eighth century,
such as Redux on the 27th March († 584), Agnellus on
the 9th January († 691), Adeodatus on the 1st October
(† 671), Fortunatus on the 14th June († 600 circ.),
Paulus the elder on the 3rd March († 760). The last
to be named is probably Paul the younger on the 17th
February († 820).<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> Paul III. of Constantinople cannot
be intended here, for his day is the 30th August. We
may add that the feast of All Saints had not yet been
admitted, a circumstance which throws light on the
probable date when this calendar was drawn up. Special
importance attaches to this calendar on account of its
intermediate position between the calendars of the
Eastern and Western Churches.</p>

<p>It was discovered in 1742 in S. Giovanni Maggiore
and edited incorrectly, according to Mai, by Marinius,
correctly by Mazzochius (Naples, 1744). The most
recent edition is by A. Mai himself.<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<h3>10. <i>Western Authorities from the Sixth to the Eighth
Centuries</i></h3>

<p>In the West the worship of the saints exerted a much
stronger influence on the liturgy than in the East. The
Roman and kindred rites provided special Masses for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
saints’ days, while in the East the worship of saints
as far as it effected the liturgy continued to be limited
to the canonical hours. At first the lections used at
the Psalmody were drawn from the Holy Scriptures
alone, but from the sixth century, passages from the
<i>passiones martyrum</i> were admitted.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> In course of time,
these became more numerous, and in this way the
martyrologies obtained an ever increasing importance.
As regards the Mass, in the earliest Gallican Masses published
by Mone, we find one for the feast of St Germanus,<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>
and several in the <i>Sacramentarium Leoninum</i>, and for
many centuries the Masses for saints’ days remained
considerably less numerous than the Masses <i>de tempore</i>.
Later on, however, they became so numerous that they
were finally indicated in a special calendar bound up
with the sacramentary, such as is now prefixed to the
massal as one of its integral parts. Equally important
with the sacramentaries in this connection are the
service-books, containing the epistles and gospels,
called lectionaries. We shall examine these first, and
then those of the martyrologies specially bearing upon
the subject we are investigating, and afterwards we
shall utilise whatever we find in the sacramentaries
in connection with saints’ days.</p>

<p>The lectionaries of Luxenil and Silos show very plainly
that in the seventh century the worship of the saints
had as yet very slightly affected the liturgy. The
saints’ days are somewhat more numerous in the
<i>Leoninum</i> and in the <i>Missale Gothico-Gallicanum</i> edited
by Mabillon and belonging to the end of the same
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span></p>

<p>In both the other Roman sacramentaries the increase of
saints’ days is noticeable. The <i>Gelasianum</i> was originally
drawn up especially for the city of Rome, but the recension
in which it has come down to us was obviously
compiled at the request of some other church; at
any rate it contains a number of saints who do not
belong to the city of Rome. For instance, on the 7th
August we have the Confessor Donatus who belongs
to Imola, on the 19th a martyr called Magnus who can
only be assigned to Cæsarea in Cappadocia, and on the
27th a martyr Rufus belonging to Capua; the appearance
of the legendary family of martyrs Marius, Martha,
Audifax, and Ambacum or Habacuc is curious, and in
addition to these, there is also a number of saints whose
names one would search for in vain in the better and
older recensions of the <i>Gregorianum</i>, <i>e.g.</i> Soter, Vitalis,
Felicula, Juliana, Euphemia, Juvenal, Nereus and
Achilleus, Cyrinus, Nabor, Nazarius, and Vitus. Of
these many were certainly venerated in Rome, yet had
hitherto received no recognition in the calendars
attached to the service-books.</p>

<p>For the Gregorian Sacramentary, the edition most
frequently employed is that of Menard printed in
Migne. According to the introduction, it is taken
from a <i>codex S. Eligii</i> and a somewhat later <i>codex
Rodradi</i>, which, in Menard’s opinion, was written about
853, but even the earlier codex has additions belonging
to a later period, <i>e.g.</i> Projectus (25th January)<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
and Leo (28th June), as a comparison with the Mainz
codex of St Alban shows. This codex (<i>i.e.</i> of St Eligius)
according to the received opinion, was written between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
834 and 847, and consists of three different parts, proceeding
indeed from the same hand, but clearly distinguished
from one another. The first part contains
the <i>Gregorianum</i> (fol. 1-129) to which have been added
as an appendix the Masses of St Alban, SS. Sergius
and Bacchus, All Saints’, and St Augustine, which
the transcriber did not find in the original. In the
second part (Collectio ii., fol. 165-183) the expressions
<i>contestatio</i> and <i>ad complendum</i> are used which show
it to be of Frankish origin, and like the first part it contains
the ecclesiastical year, beginning with Christmas.
The third part (fol. 183-204) contains a few additions
consisting of prayers and Masses for special occasions.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the first part still has the
obsolete feast of the 13th May, <i>Dedicatio S. Mariæ ad
Martyrs</i>, and only the <i>Natalis S. Cæsarii</i> on the 1st
November, the Mass for All Saints’ being placed at the
end, and not in its proper place (fol. 131). This recalls
the circumstance that Gregory IV. (827-844) transferred
the feast of the 13th May to the 1st November.
This change was also introduced into the Frankish
empire in 835. The original document was then certainly
written before 835, or indeed earlier, for
the <i>litania minor</i>, introduced into the Roman rite by
Leo III. about 801, is not given; nevertheless the
three chief feasts of our Lady are already inserted in
their proper places. In the following period until the
fifteenth century only a limited number of new saints’
days were added to the Roman Missal. A missal
written in 1374—<i>Ordo Missalis secundum Consuetudinem
Romanæ Curiæ</i>—belonging to the Public Library of
Munich, shows an increase of only twenty-five Masses
for saints’ days over the <i>Gregorianum</i> after more than
five hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span></p>

<p>Fronteau, chancellor of the University of Paris,
published a lectionary which has important bearings
on the study of liturgies; he took it from a codex
written in gold characters belonging to the Church of
St Geneviève in Paris.<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> The editor correctly described
it as appertaining to the city of Rome, because the
Roman station churches are given, and the saints
mentioned almost all belong to the city of Rome. The
omission of the festival of St Petronilla (the 31st May)
is of importance in fixing the date of this document,
for Gregory III. was the first to add the Church of the
<i>Cœmeterium S. Petronillæ</i> to the other station churches.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>
Petronilla had already been regarded as a saint in the
city of Rome, but her festival had not made its way
into the liturgy because no <i>statio</i> was held in her Church
or in her <i>Cœmeterium</i>. The <i>Litania Minor</i> on the three
days before the Ascension, introduced into the Roman
rite by Leo III., is also not to be found here. The
editor, however, deduces that the Lectionary of St
Geneviève is later than Gregory II. from the fact that
the Thursdays in Lent are provided with an <i>officium</i>
of their own, an addition introduced first by this pope.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly this lectionary was composed under
Gregory II., between 714 and 731, and it is of great importance
for the liturgical student. Its manner of
naming the Sundays after Pentecost deserves especially
to be noticed, the feasts of our Lady of the 15th
August and the 8th September do not fall on these days,
but on the 14th August and the 9th September, and the
beheading of St John the Baptist on the 30th August.
The only Greek saint mentioned is Mennas and the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
non-Italian, St Cyprian. The <i>Cathedra Petri</i>, <i>Exaltatio
Crucis</i> (3rd May), and <i>Joannes ante Portam
Lat.</i> (6th May), are not yet known, and on the 28th
June, where <i>Leo II. Papa et Confessor</i> now stands, we
have a <i>Translatio corporis S. Leonis</i>. Fronteau points
out that this cannot refer to Leo II.<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<h3>11. <i>The Martyrologies of Bede, Florus, Wandelbert, and
Œngus</i><a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></h3>

<p>Before the ninth century, the Frankish Church had
produced no martyrology of its own, apart from the
so-called <i>Hieronymianum</i>, but on the other hand the
young Anglo-Saxon Church put out a work of this kind
in the eighth century, its author being the learned historian
of the Anglo-Saxon Church, the Venerable Bede.
Whether he undertook the work spontaneously or at
the desire of his superiors, whether it was intended
merely for his own monastery, or for a wider circle are
questions which cannot be answered, for there is no
introduction to the work to inform us on these points.
The work was used in the Frankish empire as is proved
by the MSS. of it found there as well as by the later
additions of Florus.</p>

<p>Bede composed his <i>Martyrologium</i> in 731, as he
informs us at the conclusion of his history.<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> It was his
intention to give in addition to the days of the saints’
deaths, the nature of their deaths, and the names of
the judges by whom they were condemned, for by this
means the date of their deaths could be determined
with certainty. The basis of his work was the existing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
Roman Calendar while he exceeded its limits in many
directions. In the first place, he added to it the saints
of England such as were then venerated; these were
few in number, Alban, Cuthbert, Augustine, Mellitus,
Etheltrud, Victor and Paulinus (10th October), Brigid,
etc. Then a comparatively large number of names of
Frankish saints were also introduced, <i>e.g.</i> Maximin of
Treves (31st May), Clodoald (St Cloud), Remigius,
Denys, Lambert († 17th September 709), the Theban
legion, and a few others. Bede rises still further above
the standpoint of national churches and particularism
by admitting some names from the Old Testament,
<i>e.g.</i> Ezechiel (10th April), Jeremias (1st May), Eliseus
(14th June), Isaias (6th July), Samuel (20th August),
etc.; the dates on which they are commemorated being
taken for the most part from Greek menologies.</p>

<p>Bede collected material for his <i>Martyrologium</i> with
great diligence, and enriched his subject matter with
notes from his own reading, as is shown for instance
by his reference to St Cyprian’s treatise <i>De
Lapsis</i> in connection with the martyrs Castus and
Æmilius (22nd May) who are named in it; other sources
upon which he also drew were the <i>Gesta Pontificum</i>,
the writings of Eusebius, St Gregory’s Dialogues, and
especially a number of <i>Passiones Martyrum</i>. Bede’s
work shows both diligence and originality, and an
intelligent employment of the materials which came
to hand. Yet, in spite of his diligence, he found material
to fill up only a hundred and eighty days, and so the
half of the year remains vacant; still his compilation
is fuller than the Frankish calendars of the eighth
century, and the notes attached to the names of each
saint are remarkable for brevity and precision.</p>

<p>Although the value of Bede’s work is incontestable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
it was soon found insufficient; it was diligently copied,
and used, but additions of all sorts were made to it as
is proved by the large number of variations in the existing
MSS. Perhaps it met with more acceptance
abroad than at home, for the thirteenth canon of the
second council of Cloveshove which met in 747, only
twelve years after Bede’s death, enjoined the use of the
Roman martyrology, without even mentioning Bede.</p>

<p>As regards its publication, the martyrology of Bede
was printed for the first time in Cologne in 1616, but as
in the text thus published, all the days of the year are
provided with the names of saints, it is impossible that
it represents the original text of Bede, for all old writers
agree in stating that in it many days were left vacant.
The Bollandist Henschen found first of all a fragment of
the genuine Bede among the MSS. of Queen Christina of
Sweden, and then, later on, the complete text at Dijon.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>Bede’s martyrology was newly worked over and considerably
enlarged by a certain Florus; according to
Wandelbert of Prüm,<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> this was the subdeacon Florus
of Lyons, who, later on, as deacon, wrote against Scotus
Erigena in 852, and died in 860; he was a contemporary
of Wandelbert’s. Against this must be set down
the authority of Trithemius, who considers that this
Florus was a Monk of the monastery of St Trudo in the
diocese of Liège about 760. Although Trithemius gives
no authority for this statement, still writers on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
history of literature, especially Fabricius, are in complete
agreement with him. Still which ever of the two
is correct, one is inclined to ask how it came to pass that
so striking an enlargement of the work—each day of the
year being provided with the name of a saint—could
have appeared so soon after Bede and before the appearance
of the great martyrology of Ado.</p>

<p>Wandelbert of Prüm turned Bede’s martyrology into
verse in the twenty-fifth year of the Emperor Lothaire
I. (848); his version is of no importance for the
history and development of this department of
liturgical studies, yet it may be consulted for questions
connected with local history.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>The martyrology of Œngus the Culdee, written in the
ancient Irish (Celtic) language certainly belongs to the
same period. Nothing further is known of the author
except that he was a monk in the Monastery of Conenagh
in the ninth century. The martyrology is written in
rhymed verse, extends over the entire year, and contains
for the most part the names of Irish saints.<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Certainly
later is the similar work of Gorman, Abbot of Louth in
Leinster. It was written in unrhymed verse between
1166 and 1174.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<h3>12. <i>The Martyrologies of Ado, Usuardus, Rabanus
Maurus, and Notker Balbulus</i></h3>

<p>The most important document in this department
of literature, and one which bears directly upon scientific
investigations, is the martyrology of Ado, Bishop
of Vienne. Ado was born in northern France about
800, and entered at an early age the Monastery of
Ferrières in the diocese of Sens, from whence he was sent
to the Monastery of Prüm where he lived for many years
under Abbot Markward (829-853). In consequence of
some misunderstandings he left Prüm and went to Rome,
where he spent five years and then went to Ravenna.
He returned to France later and lived for some time as a
simple monk in a monastery in the neighbourhood of
Lyons. After the death of Bishop Agilmar of Vienne
(† 7th July 860) he succeeded to the see and died on the
16th December 873.</p>

<p>He compiled the martyrology which bears his name
in 858 before he became bishop,<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> the basis of his work
being a very ancient martyrology with which he had
become acquainted in Ravenna. If his information
can be trusted, a bishop of Ravenna, whose name he
does not give, received this ancient document from a
bishop of Rome who is also nameless. The rest of the
material he collected himself, and in particular he made
notes of any information concerning martyrs which
had come in his way. Many of the sources at his disposal
have since been lost, thus rendering his martyrology
all the more important for us.</p>

<p>It consists of three parts: 1. A calendar containing
the names of one or more saints for each day accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
by notices naturally brief; in the printed
edition it bears incorrectly the title, <i>Vetus Martyrologium
Romanum</i>, given to it by its first editors, Jacob
Mosander and Heribert Rosweyde;<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> 2. <i>A Libellus de
Festivitatibus SS. Apostolorum</i>;<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> 3. The martyrology
itself,<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> consisting of extracts from the acts of the martyrs
and other writings.</p>

<p>His preface contains matter which deserves attention.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
He had often been urged, he says, by holy men,
by his superiors, and by Bishop Remigius of Lyons to
complete the martyrology; since the martyrology of
Bede, which Florus had enlarged, still leaves many days
without saints, he had undertaken to fill up these gaps,
and for this purpose he had made use of the MSS. describing
the sufferings of the martyrs, from which he
had made quotations for the benefit of the weaker
brethren; the ancient martyrology which came
originally from Rome, served him as a foundation upon
which to build.</p>

<p>The frank avowal of his intention to fill in the spaces
left vacant by his predecessors, might create a prejudice
against the trustworthiness and excellence of his
work, but a closer inspection will dispel this suspicion,
and this would be still more the case had we the
original form of the work before us; in the existing
editions there are additions of a later date, such as the
name Rictiovarus.</p>

<p>From the entries on the 20th April and the 17th
November it is plain that the Cologne MS. of this martyrology
edited by Rosweyde comes from Stablo, and it
may have been that at Stablo the names of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
Frankish saints were inserted into it. Ado went much
further than Bede in admitting names from the Old
Testament. Roseweyde’s conjecture that this calendar,
the so-called “Little Ado,” is the Roman martyrology
mentioned by Gregory I. in his letter to Eulogius, is
devoid of proof and obviously mistaken, for in that
document there were no Old Testament names. This
“Little Ado” is not a martyrology at all, but a
calendar, and displays none of the peculiarities which
characterise the calendars of the city of Rome of that
date; neither is it an independent work, but only an
abstract made by Ado from his own larger work, and a
summary of its contents. The preface prefixed to the
two other parts is chiefly concerned with the martyrology,
and not with this abstract, and it is only the circumstance
that this abstract is found in MSS., with some
later additions and altogether separate from the larger
work, which led the first editor to regard it as a treatise
by itself; it is merely the abstract used at Stablo and
Malmedy, and not an original Roman work, though
it is plain from Ado’s preface that the existing Roman
calendar was employed in its composition.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>Two or three decades later, Usuardus composed his
martyrology after Ado’s example, which he dedicated
to Charles the Bald in 875. Usuardus was a monk of
St Germain des Près, then outside the gates of Paris,
but now surrounded by the city; his work is by no
means so full as Ado’s, but is more polished in style,
and more uniform in its treatment of the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
entries, and on this account is more suited for use in
choir. It was accordingly used throughout the entire
West, and in all Benedictine monasteries,<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> and even in
Rome itself with the exception of the Vatican basilica.
At the end of the fifteenth century it was so to speak,
the universal martyrology of the Western Church, and
indeed no other was known.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>The value of these works depends naturally upon the
sources employed by the redactor, and also upon his
personal qualities, as, for instance, whether he revelled
in the miraculous or was inclined to be critical.</p>

<p>Two martyrologies by German authors must now
be dealt with—those of Rabanus Maurus and Notker
Balbulus.</p>

<p>The former when Archbishop of Mainz completed
a martyrology which he had compiled from secondary
sources; it is dedicated to Abbot Radleich of
Seligenstadt, who died in 853-54, and whose epitaph
was composed by Rabanus,<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> but the composition of the
martyrology must be dated a few years earlier, about
850, though the exact date cannot be discovered. As
sources, he drew upon the Acts of the martyrs which he
found ready to hand, and also the <i>Hieronymianum</i>,
Bede, and Florus; the treatment of the material is
very unequal, sometimes a long account being given,
sometimes nothing more than the name; legends and
historical errors are frequent.</p>

<p>The same is true of the martyrology of Notker
Balbulus who was a monk at St Gall from 840 to 912,
and composed his work under Pope Formosus (891-896).
He knew and used the <i>Hieronymianum</i>, as, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
example, for the 9th August, <i>V. Id. Aug.</i> First class
sources were beyond his reach, a loss of which he was
himself conscious.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>All these martyrologies of which we have spoken,
were private compilations without anything of an
official character about them. The existence of so
many following upon the <i>Hieronymianum</i> shows that
it did not satisfy liturgical requirements and was little
used. On this account, martyrologies were drawn up at a
later date containing full descriptions of the lives and
sufferings of the saints for each day of the year, which
would serve as edifying and entertaining reading for
religious, priests and other pious persons. However
even the best of them were no longer practicable in the
sixteenth century, and Gregory XIII. conceived the
purpose of putting out one better adapted for use in
divine service. A further step was taken in 1580 when
he commissioned the learned Cardinal Sirleto to compare
the martyrology used in Rome with the oldest and best
MSS. and to correct the errors which had crept into it in
course of time.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> Sirleto associated ten other learned
men with himself among whom were Cæsar Baronius
and Aloysius Lilius, the astronomer. Baronius was the
soul of the undertaking, and, after three years’ labour,
the <i>Martyrologium Romanum Gregorii XIII.</i> was completed,
and a papal brief of the 14th January 1584, prescribed
the exclusive use of this work in choir at the
canonical hours. Baronius based his labours on
Usuardus, correcting and enlarging his martyrology by
means of the materials then forthcoming; could he
have used the materials discovered later, or those which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
we now possess, his work would naturally have been
much better; many, too, of the earlier mistakes remain
uncorrected. The editors were far from claiming
freedom from errors for their work, and made improvements
in later editions, beginning with that of 1586.
It is not necessary to regard all the individuals named
in the Roman martyrology as saints in the liturgical
sense of the word, and their admission there, according
to the expression of Benedict XIV. is in no wise equal
to canonisation.<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> Since the time of Baronius, the
official martyrology has indeed remained untouched,
but science has not been inactive during this long
period; much has been explained and corrected, and,
on the whole, it has come to be recognised as a principle
which must be followed in investigating the histories of
the saints of ancient times, that recourse is to be had
to the earliest existing sources of information, and
also, where the evidence is contradictory, local official
sources, where they exist, are to have the preference.</p>

<h3>13. <i>Important Calendars from the Eighth to the Eleventh
Centuries</i></h3>

<p>While the martyrologies were for the most part the
outcome of individual effort, the calendars, on the other
hand, are entirely official in their origin. In times when
annual calendars, like our present ordos, had not yet appeared,
their place was taken by the official calendar, and
every one had to make out his ordo for himself with its
assistance. From many points of view they are more
important for our purpose than the martyrologies.</p>

<p>As complete missals took the place of the sacramentaries
they were usually provided with a table, like an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
index, which gave a list of the saints’ days contained
in the missal; these so-called calendars have from
then until now formed an integral part of written and
printed missals, and even appear by themselves like
abbreviated martyrologies. A remarkably large number
of calendars of this kind have come down to us from
the Middle Ages, and, since they are important for the
history of local churches, they have recently been published,
as, for example, by Martène-Durand, Misset
and Weale, Grotefend, Ulysse Chevalier, Lechler, etc.<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
For our purpose, the following deserve to be noticed:</p>

<p>1. A Roman calendar of the seventh century, discovered
by Prof. de Ram, and printed in Binterim,
Denkw. vii. 56-67. It begins with Christmas, March
is called <i>mensis primus</i>, the station churches of Rome
are given in Lent, on the 13th May there is the
<i>Dedicatio Mariæ ad Martyres</i>, All Saints does not appear.
The only litany is the so-called <i>litania major</i>; the
Annunciation and the <i>Cathedra Petri</i> are omitted, in
March a <i>pascha annotina</i> is inserted without date, St
Athanasius is passed over on the 20th January; there
are only faint traces of Advent. This calendar is very
ancient and formed part of the codex of the gospels
written under Louis the Pious; in the time of Lothaire
I., it belonged to the Monastery of Münsterbilsen in the
diocese of Liège.</p>

<p>2. A calendar belonging to Bologna. It is found in a
codex of the Monastery of Leno, was discovered by
Giovanni Mercati in the Ambrosiana, and published
in the Révue Bénédictine, 1902 (353-355). It has the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
<i>Ordinatio Episcopatus Jacobi Apost.</i> on the 27th
December, and, on the 17th May a <i>natalis S. Marci
Evang.</i>, found nowhere else.</p>

<p>3. The so-called calendar of Charlemagne forms,
along with an Easter table, the beginning of an
<i>Evangeliarum</i> written in 781 by command of the
emperor and his consort by a scribe called Godescale.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>
It is only deserving of notice from the number of names
of Frankish saints inserted into a calendar originally
Roman, <i>e.g.</i> Bishop Maximin of Treves (31st May),
Boniface (5th June), Medard (8th June), Martialis
(30th June) Kilian (1st August), Mauritius (22nd
September), Remigius (1st October), etc. The Apostle
Thomas is placed, strange to say, on the 3rd July, and
St Petronilla on the 31st May.</p>

<p>4. A calendar is incorporated in a treatise <i>De Computo</i>,
by an unknown author, written in 810 (published by
Muratori, <i>Analecta</i>, iii. 108, and also in Migne, <i>Patr.
Lat.</i>, cxxix. 1274). It seems to come from the diocese
of Sens on account of <i>S. Columbæ Virg.</i> on the 31st
December; All Saints is omitted. This calendar is
Roman with Frankish additions; for the date see chap.
153, Migne, cxxix., 1364.</p>

<p>5. The last four months of the year are unfortunately
missing from the calendar of Alt-Corbie (Corbeiense)
given by Martène-Durand, <i>Thes. Nov. Anced.</i>, iii., 1591,
Paris, 1717. The same is the case with a very old
calendar of Tours.</p>

<p>6. Codex 83ᴵᴵ. of the cathedral library in Cologne
contains an ancient calendar, fol. 72 B-76. This codex
contains a large collection of annalistical writings and
computation tables and was written under Archbishop
Hildebold. The second treatise in the volume is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
Isidore’s chronicle which concludes with the words:
“Seven hundred and eighty-nine years have passed
since Christ’s Nativity”; further on, fol. 76 B, was
inserted after the death of Charlemagne, and also of
Hildebold (818). Thus the codex was written between
798 and 818, and belonged to the old cathedral of Cologne
which was dedicated to St Peter. The calendar, however,
does not belong to Cologne for the local saints are
absent, but there is a number of names of Frankish
saints, pointing to the north of France as the locality
where it was drawn up; no explanation of the legend
of St Ursula can be learnt from it. For a calendar of
its early date, it is remarkably full of saints, while the
Cologne Calendar, shortly to be referred, to has many
vacant days. The codex has been described by Jaffé
and Wattenbach, <i>Ecclesiæ Metrop. Colon. codices
manuscripti</i>, Berlin, 1874, 29 <i>et seqq.</i></p>

<p>7. The <i>Gellonense</i> comes from the Monastery of St
Guillaume du Désert in the diocese of Lodève, and belongs
to the beginning of the ninth century, and has been
edited by D’Achery, <i>Spicilegium</i>, ii. 25 <i>et seqq.</i> It begins
with Christmas and is preceded by a <i>Breviarum
Apostolorum</i> in thirteen sections containing information
concerning the apostles.</p>

<p>8. A <i>Kalendarium Gothicum</i> (ed. Lorenzana) of the
seventh century (Migne, lxxxvi. 38 <i>et seqq.</i>). Besides this,
there is the Mozarabic <i>Sanctorale</i> (<i>ib.</i> 1031 <i>et seqq.</i>) and a
fragment of a <i>Kalendarium Gothico-Hispanum</i> (Migne,
lxxxv. 1050 <i>et seqq.</i>).</p>

<p>Of later date, but still always useful for historical
investigation are:—</p>

<p>9. Two Anglo-Saxon calendars of the tenth century
belonging apparently to the diocese of Winchester
(Migne, lxxii. 619 <i>et seqq.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span></p>

<p>10. Two from Corbie; in Martène and Durand (<i>Thes.
Nov. Anecd.</i>, iii. 1571-1594).</p>

<p>11. A calendar of Floriac and a martyrology of
Auxerre (Migne, cxxxviii. 1186-1258).</p>

<p>12. A calendar of Mantua and two of Vallombrosa
(<i>Ib.</i> 1258 <i>et seqq.</i>).</p>

<p>13. A calendar of Besançon of the eleventh century,
which goes by the name of <i>S. Protadii</i> (Migne, lxxx. 411),
and an old French calendar called after the name of its
first owner Chauvellin (Migne, lxxii. 607).</p>

<p>For convenience we separate the most ancient calendars
of German origin from the others, and consider
them by themselves.</p>

<p>1. The oldest calendar of Mainz belongs to the first
half of the ninth century, and was published from a
codex in the Vatican by Jostes in the Zeitschrift für
deutsches Altertum (Schröder and Röthe) for 1896,
148-158. All Saints is absent, and the resurrection of
Christ is entered on the 25th March.</p>

<p>2. A <i>Kalendarium Verdinense</i>, from the Monastery
of Werden on the Ruhr, published by Bandini (<i>Catal.
Bibl. Lauretianæ Suppl.</i>, Migne, cxxxviii. 1203 <i>et seqq.</i>).
It contained All Saints, and the <i>Dedicatio S. Mariæ
s. Turris Vincentii</i> on the 13th May as well. Among
the special saints of Cologne are given the two Ewalds,
Kunibert, Gereon, the Moors, and the eleven thousand
virgins, but without Ursula, and designated as simply
virgins and not martyrs; it also contains the names
of the two first bishops of Halberstadt, Thiatgrim († 840)
and Hildegrim († 21st December 888), which indicates the
date of its composition, and it has the name of the first
abbot of Werden, Hetharicus, and the <i>Dedicatio Eccl.
Majoris</i>. Unfortunately the months from April to July
are missing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span></p>

<p>3. The sacramentary in the cathedral library of
Cologne (codex 88, fol. 3-9) contains a complete calendar
for this cathedral. It is essentially the Roman Calendar
of the ninth century, with the addition of the local saints
of Cologne, the two Ewalds, Kunibert, Brictius, Quintinus,
Severin, Gereon and his 318 companions, the
360 Moors, and the 11,000 virgins without Ursula, and
designated simply as virgins. Other names deserving
notice are: Briga (Brigida) 1st February, Arealis (?)
28th April, <i>Marcus episcopus</i>, Boniface the martyr,
Medard, Lambert, and Mauricius with 6666 companions.
The calendar belongs to the second half of the ninth
century, and is proved to have belonged to the cathedral
of Cologne begun by Hildebold and consecrated by
Willibert in 873, by the fact that it gives the day of the
consecration of the cathedral correctly (23rd September),
and is described as belonging to the Church of St Peter,
to whom the former cathedral was dedicated. The
sacramentary, but not the calendar, has been printed
by J. Pamelius in his “Liturgicon Ecclesiæ Latinæ,”
tom. ii. (Col. Agr. 1571), but unfortunately with so many
arbitrary alterations that it is quite useless as an edition
of the text.</p>

<p>4. In the library at Düsseldorf there is a sacramentary,
(codex D. I.) written in the lifetime of Bishop Altfrid
of Hildesheim († 874), which contains (fol. 217-222) a
calendar showing northern French influence. Only the
11,000 virgins are given of the local saints of Cologne,
and here again Ursula is not named, and the virgins
are not called martyrs. The book belonged to the
Convent of Essen on the Ruhr founded by Altfrid. This
MS. gives in fol. 64 A the order of the festivals observed
within the jurisdiction of the monastery during the
ninth century: “Istas præcipuas solemnitates in anno<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
totus populus sabbatizare debet: In die Nat. Domini
dies IV., in octabas Domini, in Teophania, in Purificatione
Mariæ, in Pascha Domini dies IV., in Ascensione
Domini, in Pentecoste dies IV., in Nat. S. Johannis,
in Nat. Sanctorum Apostolorum Petri et Pauli, in
Assumptione S. Mariæ, in Nat. S. Remedii [Remigii],
in Missa Michahelis, in Solemnitate Omnium Sanctorum,
in Nat. S. Martini, in Nat. S. Andreæ.”</p>

<p>Binterim published a Cologne calendar, apparently
of the ninth century, under the title <i>Kalendarium
Ecclesiæ Germ. Coloniensis Sæculi Noni</i> (Cologne, 1824),
and Harless attributes it to the second half of the same
century (Archiv. f. die Gesch. des Niederrheins, vi. 67).
It is, however, much later, for it gives all the feasts of
the apostles, and provides them with vigils, and all the
days of the year are filled in with the names of saints.
For these reasons I should date the calendar as belonging
to the eleventh century at the earliest.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Kalendarium Germanicum Pervetustum Sæc.
X.</i>, printed by M. Fr. Beck (Aug. Vind., 1687). Gerbert
(<i>Mon. Lit. Alem.</i> i. 455 A. I.) correctly regards it as
coming from Alsace and probably from Strassburg,
because it contains the saints venerated in that city,
Arbogast (20th July), Florentius, Ottilia and Aurelia.
The basis of this document is again the Roman Calendar,
still many Frankish saints have been added, but Gereon
alone of the saints of Cologne. The latest date given
in it is the <i>Dormitio S. Uodalrici</i> (4th July). It has only
one name from the Old Testament, that of the prophet
Ezechiel.</p>

<p>6. A calendar of Freising, drawn up under Bishop
Abraham, between 893 and 993. The 25th March is
marked as <i>Conceptio Domini</i>. There is only one feast
of St Peter’s Chair. The calendar has been printed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
Lechler, “Mittelalterliche Kirchenfeste und Kalendarien
in Bayern,” Freiburg, 1891.</p>

<p>7. The so-called <i>Martyrologium Stabulense</i>, the
calendar of the Monastery of Stablo. The date of the
original MS. can be deduced from the fact that on the
<i>vii. Idus Junii</i> the coronation of King Henry II., which
was performed by Archbishop Willigis at Mainz on the
7th June 1002, is entered by the first hand, while the
ordination of Archbishop Tagino of Magdeburg in the
2nd February 1004, has been entered by a second hand.
Archbishop Tagino’s death is not entered. The
calendar has only Gereon with 319 companions of the
local saints of Cologne. St Ulrich of Augsburg, although
he died in 997, is entered by the second hand.
The calendar has been published by Martène, <i>Ampl.
Coll.</i>, and by Zaccaria, <i>Antiq. Med. Ævi</i> (see Migne,
cxxxviii. 1194).</p>

<p>8. Hontheim has published the five most ancient
calendars of Treves in the <i>Prodromus Historiæ Trevirensis</i>,
i. 378-405. According to him, only the first
belongs to the tenth century, all the others being later.
For a calendar of the tenth century, it is very full of
names, many of them being from the old Testament—Ezechial,
Daniel, etc.; it mentions neither the legend
of the Innumerable Company of Martyrs at Treves on
the 4th and 5th October, nor Palmatius, Thyrsus, etc.;
neither does it contain All Souls, St Catherine, or St
Peter’s Chair, but it has Gereon and his 318 companions.
It is only in the fourth and fifth calendars which belong
to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that Thyrsus,
Palmatius, etc., appear.</p>

<p>When one considers the details presented by calendars,
one is bound to acknowledge that the Roman
<i>Depositio Martyrum</i> stands at the head of this long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
line of liturgical documents, and was the model after
which they were composed. Like them, the <i>Depositio
Martyrum</i> was drawn up according to months, and
commenced with Christmas. Like them, it contained
the official list of the martyrs who received ecclesiastical
veneration in the local church of Rome in the fourth
century. Were it not so, it would not have deserved
to be incorporated in the Philocalian collection, the
<i>Hemerologium Valentini</i>, since this comprised only
official documents; had it not been official it would
not have been worth transcribing.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>All estates of men in the Church have had their share
in the formation of the ecclesiastical year, for the growth
of the Church’s festivals has continued without interruption
from the beginning until now, and has extended
over all the countries of Christendom. Having
wended our way through the centuries and arrived at
the conclusion of our work, it is a pleasure to render our
tribute of thanks and praise to the men who have in the
past made this sphere of study their own.</p>

<p>The few writers of the Middle Ages who treated the
Church’s year and the festivals of the saints in a comprehensive
manner were entirely occupied with contributing
to the correct performance of ecclesiastical
ceremonies, and with explaining why each ceremony
must be done in one way and not in another. They not
infrequently brought allegorical and symbolical considerations
to bear on the question.</p>

<p>In more modern times, Cornelius Schulting, a native
of Steenwijk in North Holland, and afterwards professor
of theology at Cologne and canon of St Andrew’s († 1604)
undertook a full exposition of the matter; his object
was mainly practical, and his work can only be regarded
as a first attempt. The keen controversialist,
Jacobus Gretser S.J. († 1625), is more occupied with his
polemic against the Calvinists than with lucid demonstration.
More in harmony with modern requirements,
is the French oratorian Louis Thomassin, a native of
Aix in Provence, and a partisan of Port Royal, who
died in 1695; he wrote a small compendium which
may be used with profit at the present day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span></p>

<p>The study of the ecclesiastical year was considerably
advanced by the labours of Adrien Baillet, born in 1649,
in the diocese of Beauvais († 1706), parish priest of a
small country living at Baumont and librarian to M. de
Lamoignon; he was entirely devoted to the pursuit
of knowledge, and scarcely ever allowed himself any
relaxation. He composed a great work worthy of ranking
alongside the labours of Tillemont, to whom he is
closely related in spirit. The course of his historical
treatment of the subject is considerably obscured by the
superabundance of biographical matter. Two valuable
monographs were published by Prosper Lambertini (Pope
Benedict XIV.) when bishop of Bologna, which treat
in a masterly manner of the feasts of our Lord and of
our Lady respectively.</p>

<p>Finally, the learned priest of Bilk, near Düsseldorf,
Fr. Ant. Binterim († 1855) dealt with this subject in one
volume of his <i>Denkwürdigkeiten</i>. He treats in the first
place of the observance of Sunday, then of the Sundays
of the Church’s year in general, and finally of the movable
and immovable feasts. Of these he naturally deals
only with the most important, following the order of the
calendar, by which arrangement Christmas comes last.</p>

<p>The author of this book commenced his researches by
a comparative study of the martyrologies, calendars,
annals, and works dealing with the computation of time,
and then set to work upon the historical and liturgical
material which he had before him from the point of
vantage thus obtained. The fortunate circumstance
that the most of the works required for this branch of
study are contained in Migne’s collection, renders the
labour of comparison possible, and frequently brings
remarkable parallels to light.</p>

<p>(<i>A</i>) A marked increase appears in the statute of Lanfranc,
Archbishop of Canterbury († 1089). He divides the festivals into
three classes. In the first class he reckons five, the three chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
festivals of the Christian year, the Assumption, and the feast of the
local patron; in the second, Epiphany, Candlemas, St Gregory,
the Annunciation, Low Sunday, St Alphege, the Ascension, St
Augustine of Canterbury, the Octave of Pentecost, the Nativity of
St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and Paul, the Translation of the
Relics of St Benedict, the Nativity of our Lady, St Michael, All
Saints, St Andrew, and the Dedication of the Church; the
festivals belonging to the third class were St Vincent, the Conversion
of St Paul, SS. Philip and James, the Exaltation of the
Cross (3rd May), St James (29th July), St Peter’s Chains, St
Lawrence, the Octave of the Assumption, St Bartholomew, St
Augustine of Hippo, the Beheading of St John the Baptist, the
Invention of the Cross, St Matthew, SS. Simon and Jude, St
Martin, and St Thomas.</p>

<p>Lanfranc issued this decree as archbishop, still it was only to
hold good for the Benedictine monasteries and the Cathedral.<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<h4 id="APPENDIX_II_b">(p. <a href="#Page_25">25</a>)</h4>

<p>(<i>B</i>) The festivals of obligation for the archdiocese of Cologne
were regulated according to the months by the provincial synod
of 1308. January: the Circumcision, Epiphany, St Agnes, the
Conversion of St Paul. February: Candlemas, St Peter’s Chair,
St Matthias. March: the Annunciation. April: Easter and St
George. May: SS. Philip and James, the Invention of the Cross.
June: the Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and Paul.
July: St Mary Magdalen, St James, St Pantaleon. August: St
Peter’s Chains, St Lawrence, the Assumption, St Bartholomew,
the Beheading of St John the Baptist. September: the Nativity
of our Lady, the Exaltation of the Cross, St Matthew, St Michael.
October: St Gereon, the Eleven Thousand Virgins, St Severin, SS.
Simon and Jude. November: All Saints, St Martin, St Cunibert,
St Cecilia, St Catherine, St Andrew. December: St Nicholas, St
Thomas, Christmas, St Stephen, St John the Evangelist, the Holy
Innocents. In all, forty-two days.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> The feasts of Easter and
Pentecost extended over three days; the Ascension is omitted.
In the city of Cologne were celebrated in addition: the Arrival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
of the relics of the Three Holy Kings on the 23rd July, the Dedication
of the Cathedral, SS. Cosmas and Damian, the Dedication and
Patronal feast of each parish church, and, finally, the feast of
Corpus Christi was enjoined in addition.</p>

<p>The Synod of 1549 under Adolf III. gives the following list:
All Sundays, Easter, Pentecost, Christmas—two days each, the
third day <i>in choro</i> only—Circumcision, Epiphany, Ascension, the
Holy Trinity, Corpus Christi, these being feasts of our Lord. The
feasts of our Lady are: the Purification, the Annunciation, the
Visitation, the Assumption, the Nativity, the Presentation, and the
Conception. Saints’ days are as follows: all the Apostles, St
John the Baptist, St Mary Magdalen, St Lawrence, St Michael,
All Saints, St Martin, and the Dedication of the Church; there
are also six other saints’ days which were optional for places
where they were customary. The feast of the Patron Saint is passed
over, and thus a decrease of fifteen festivals is brought about.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<h4 id="APPENDIX_II_c">(p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>)</h4>

<p>(<i>C</i>) The statute of Archbishop Baldwin of Treves, published in
1338, contains fewer festivals, <i>i.e.</i> Christmas, Easter with the three
following days and Pentecost with two, Corpus Christi, Circumcision,
and Epiphany. Our Lady’s feasts were: the Nativity,
Annunciation, Purification, and Assumption; a few years later her
Conception was added. Then came the festivals of the twelve
apostles, St Michael (8th May), the Invention of the Cross, the
Nativity of St John the Baptist, St Lawrence, St Martin, St Mary
Magdalen, St Catherine, All Saints’, the Holy Innocents, the
Dedication of the Church and the feast of the Patron Saint.</p>

<h3 id="APPENDIX_III">III</h3>

<h4>(p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>)<br>
<span class="smcap">The Festivals of Obligation as observed in Different Countries</span></h4>

<p>Rome. Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, one day each; Circumcision,
Epiphany, Candlemas, St Joseph (19th March), the
Annunciation, Ascension, St Philip Neri (26th May), Corpus
Christi, the Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and Paul,
the Assumption, Nativity of Our Lady, All Saints, the Immac. Conc.,
St John the Evangelist (27th December). The civil law of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
Italian Kingdom recognises the following days as legal holidays: the
Epiphany, Ascension, Corpus Christi, SS. Peter and Paul, the feasts
of Our Lady on the 15th August, 8th September, and 8th
December, Christmas and the patron saint of the city and diocese.</p>

<p>France. In accordance with the concordat of Napoleon four
feasts were celebrated: Christmas, Ascension, the Assumption, and
All Saints. All other festivals when they fell on a week day were
transferred to the following Sunday. Even in Belgium and in the
Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, in the part of Limburg belonging to
Holland, and in the bailiwick of Meisenheim in the diocese of
Treves, this scanty provision of feasts holds good.</p>

<p>Austria. The Cis- and-Transleithan countries observe the same
holy days. Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, two days each; the
Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas, the Annunciation, the Ascension,
Corpus Christi, SS. Peter and Paul, the Assumption, All
Saints, the Immaculate Conception. The feasts of the patron
saints were transferred by Joseph II. to the following Sunday, but
in each of the Crown-lands the local patron is commemorated on
his proper day, <i>i.e.</i> in Austria above and below the Enns, the feast
of St Leopold: in Upper Austria, St Florian: in Moravia, SS. Cyril
and Methodius: in Galicia, St Stanislaus and St Michael: in
Silesia, St Hedwig: in Bohemia, St Wenceslaus and St John
Nepomuk: in Styria, Carinthia, Camiola, the provinces of the
Litoral, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vorarlberg, St Joseph: in Sclavonia,
St John the Baptist: in Hungary, St Stephen the Confessor: in
Croatia, St Elias: in Transilvania, St Ladislaus: in Salzburg,
St Rupert: in Dalmatia, St Jerome: in Goritz, St Hermagoras
and St Fortunatus.</p>

<p>In the eight old provinces of Prussia, the festivals recognised by
the state are: Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, two days each;
the Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas, Ascension, Corpus Christi,
SS. Peter and Paul, All Saints, the (Protestant) day of penitence
and prayer, the Annunciation and the Immaculate Conception. In
the archdiocese of Posen, the Nativity of Our Lady, and the
Assumption as well as St Stanislaus are observed, and in Gnesen,
St George as patron of the diocese. The new provinces have
had also to adopt the Protestant day of penitence.</p>

<p>Hanover, the dioceses of Hildesheim and Osnabrück. Besides
the days observed in Prussia, the Nativity of St John the Baptist, the
Nativity and Assumption of Our Lady, St Michael, and the local
patrons St Bernward and St Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span></p>

<p>For the countries of the Northern Mission in the diocese of
Osnabrück, the following are omitted from the list just given:
Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and Paul, and all the
feasts of Our Lady, thus leaving only Christmas, Easter, and
Pentecost, each with two days; the Circumcision, the Epiphany,
the Ascension, Corpus Christi, All Saints. This applies to Bremen,
Hamburg, Lübeck, Schleswig-Holstein, both the Mecklenburgs
and Denmark.</p>

<p>Bavaria. The following festivals are observed: Christmas,
Easter, and Pentecost, each for two days; the Circumcision,
Epiphany, Candlemas, St Joseph, the Annunciation, the Ascension,
Corpus Christi, the Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and
Paul, the Assumption and Nativity of Our Lady, All Saints, the
Immaculate Conception. Each diocese of Bavaria celebrates its
own particular patron as well.</p>

<p>The Palatinate, diocese of Spires. Here the effects of the French
dominion are still observable, and the only festivals of obligation
observed are: the Circumcision, the Ascension, Corpus Christi, the
Assumption, All Saints. Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost are
kept each for two days.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Saxony. The festivals of obligation are: the
Circumcision, the Epiphany and Annunciation, the Ascension,
Corpus Christi, SS. Peter and Paul, the Assumption, the Nativity
of Our Lady, the Immaculate Conception, All Saints; Christmas,
Easter, and Pentecost, each for two days.</p>

<p>In the ecclesiastical province of the Upper Rhine there are
different regulations in each diocese.</p>

<p>Würtemburg, diocese of Rottenburg. The Circumcision, the
Epiphany, Candlemas, the Annunciation, Ascension, Corpus Christi,
Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and Paul, the Assumption
and Nativity of Our Lady, All Saints, the Immaculate
Conception; Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, each for two
days.</p>

<p>Baden, archdiocese of Freiburg. The five chief feasts of Our
Lady are kept on the day itself; so too is the feast of St Joseph,
and the other festivals are the same as in Würtemburg, with the
exception of the 24th June.</p>

<p>Hesse-Nassau: the dioceses of Fulda and Limburg. Christmas,
Easter and Pentecost, each for two days; the Circumcision,
Epiphany, Candlemas, Annunciation, Ascension, Corpus Christi,
SS. Peter and Paul, Assumption, All Saints; the Prussian day of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
penitence is observed in November, and in Limburg, the patron
saint on his own day.</p>

<p>Hesse-Darmstadt: diocese of Mainz. The same regulations as
in the Palatinate.</p>

<p>Alsace-Lorraine. The four French holy days. An edict of
10th October 1887 adds to these Good Friday, Easter Monday,
and Whit Monday, as general holidays in the legal sense, and as
holidays and days of rest in the sense of the Code de procédure
civile.</p>

<p>In Holland, in the archdiocese of Utrecht, and in the diocese of
Harlem, the following rank as full holy days on which no work is
to be done: the day following the three chief feasts of the year,
the Circumcision, Epiphany, Annunciation, and the Assumption.
It is of obligation to hear mass only on Candlemas, the Nativity
of Our Lady, and the Immaculate Conception. In the dioceses
of Breda and Bois-le-Duc, these three festivals are days of full
obligation.</p>

<p>For England, Pope Pius VI. appointed the following holy days
on the 9th March 1777: Easter and Pentecost, each two days:
Christmas, the Circumcision, Epiphany, the Ascension, Corpus
Christi, the Annunciation, the Assumption, SS. Peter and Paul,
All Saints, and the feast of the patron saint. At the present
time are observed, Easter, Pentecost and Christmas, one day
each, the Circumcision, Epiphany, Ascension, Corpus Christi, SS.
Peter and Paul, the Assumption, and All Saints. St Andrew’s
day is added for Scotland, and St Patrick’s day and the Annunciation
for Ireland. The Immaculate Conception is a purely
ecclesiastical festival.</p>

<p>Switzerland affords an interesting study owing to the great
varieties existing within so small a space. The diocese of Basel-Soleure:
Christmas, the Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas,
Corpus Christi, the Assumption, All Saints, and the Immaculate
Conception. In the canton of Lucerne, St Joseph’s day and the
Annunciation are celebrated, the latter also in the canton of Zug.
The three chief festivals are kept for day only. The diocese of
Coire, comprising the cantons of Grisons, Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden,
Zurich, Glarus, and the principality of Liechtenstein: the three chief
festivals, each two days, the Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas
and St Joseph. The last two days do not rank as holy days in the
canton of Zurich, nor does the Annunciation in the cantons of
Zurich and Schwyz. The Ascension, Corpus Christi, the Nativity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
of St John the Baptist, and SS. Peter and Paul are not kept in
either of these two cantons, but the Assumption and All Saints
are kept everywhere. The Nativity of Our Lady is not kept in
Zurich and Schwyz, but the Immaculate Conception is kept
everywhere except in the canton of Zurich. The following patron
saints are kept, St Fridolin (6th March) in the canton of Glarus,
Nicholas von der Flu (21st March) in Unterwalden, St Martin
with an octave in Schwyz and Uri, St Lucius (3rd Dec.) in Coire.
St Gall, comprising the cantons of St Gall and Appenzell, keeps
the Epiphany, Candlemas, Ascension, Corpus Christi, the Assumption,
All Saints, and the Immaculate Conception; the three chief
feasts, each for two days, and St Gall’s day (16th Oct.) as patron
of the diocese. In the diocese of Geneva-Lausanne, consisting
of the four French cantons: the Circumcision, the Epiphany (with
the exception of the cantons of Geneva and Vaud), Candlemas, the
Annunciation (with the exception of Vaud and Neuchâtel), the
Ascension, Corpus Christi, Assumption, All Saints, and the
Immaculate Conception (with the exception of Geneva, Vaud,
and Neuchâtel). The three chief feasts are kept for one day each.
This is also the case in the canton of Valais, diocese of Sion, but
the following days are also kept in this canton: the Circumcision,
Epiphany, Candlemas, Annunciation, Ascension, Corpus Christi,
Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and Paul, Assumption
and Nativity of Our Lady and her Immaculate Conception, and
St Maurice as Patron Saint (22nd Sept.).</p>

<p>Russian Poland. The three chief feasts, each for two days, the
Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas, St Joseph, Annunciation,
Ascension, Corpus Christi, Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS.
Peter and Paul, Assumption, Nativity of Our Lady, All Saints, the
Immaculate Conception, St Stanislaus as patron. This last named
day is not observed in the schools and law-courts on account of its
nationalistic character.</p>

<p>Spain. The Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas, St Joseph,
Annunciation, Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, SS.
Peter and Paul, Assumption, Nativity of Our Lady, All Saints, the
Immaculate Conception, Christmas. The three chief festivals are
kept for only one day each.</p>

<p>Portugal. The three chief festivals for one day each. The
Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas, St Joseph, Annunciation,
Ascension, Corpus Christi, the Sacred Heart, St Antony of Padua
(13th June), SS. Peter and Paul, Assumption, All Saints, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
Immaculate Conception. Before the last reduction, the Nativity
of Our Lady, and from mid-day on Maundy Thursday to mid-day
on Good Friday were also holy days of obligation. Lisbon keeps
the feast of St Vincent (22nd January) as patron of the city.</p>

<p>The United States observe only six festivals which may fall on
week-days; all the others are transferred to the Sunday. These
are Christmas, the Circumcision, Ascension, Assumption, All Saints,
and the Immaculate Conception. The three chief festivals are
kept for one day only. Since the number of festivals varied
originally in the different states, an attempt was made after
uniformity, and the council of Baltimore in 1852 desired to retain
only four festivals as in France. Rome, however, was not satisfied
with this, and, in 1866, the six festivals mentioned above were
adopted. The provincial synod of Cincinnati in 1861 agreed to
adopt the Epiphany, Annunciation, and Corpus Christi as well.</p>

<p>Brazil. The three chief festivals, each for one day. The
Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas, Annunciation, Ascension,
Corpus Christi, Nativity of St John the Baptist, SS. Peter and
Paul, Assumption, Nativity of Our Lady, All Saints and the
Immaculate Conception.</p>

<p>Russia. Easter, Pentecost, Christmas, the Circumcision,
Epiphany, Ascension, Transfiguration, Candlemas, Annunciation,
our Lady’s Presentation and Assumption, and the Exaltation of
the Cross (14th Sept). All these are, of course, kept according to
the Julian calendar. To these are added the following feasts
peculiar to Russia: the three feasts of the Jordan so-called, <i>i.e.</i>
the Blessing of the Water, and the thirteen so-called Gala-feasts,
<i>i.e.</i> the commemoration of the reigning dynasty (see <i>Kirchenlexikon</i>,
X., 2nd ed. 1399). The schismatics in Austria-Hungary keep their
festivals according to the Julian calendar, so that where the
population is mixed, each feast is as a rule kept twice.</p>

<p>For many centuries the liturgical vestments were exclusively
white, like the ordinary dress of classic times. The writers of the
Carolingian period in their desire to find parallels between the
enactments of the Old and New Testaments, were the first to
remember that different colours were used in the vestments of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
Jewish high priest. In addition to the white under garment which
he wore in common with the simple priests, he wore an upper
garment of blue, and a particoloured shoulder-garment, the ephod,
of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen, interwoven with gold thread.
The repeated references to these vestments gradually led to the
adoption of coloured vestments for the mass.<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>Their introduction was at first tentative. Neither Rupert of
Deutz, Honorius of Autun, Beleth, nor Hugh of St Victor mention
the liturgical colours in their writings, or, if they do, only with
reference to the Old Testament; Sicard of Cremona, a contemporary
of Innocent III., clearly alludes to them, although he only
mentions two—white and red.<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>Innocent III. was the first to speak of all the liturgical colours,
and to regulate their use in the Roman Church, but always with
reference to the regulations of the Old Testament. According to
him, white was to be used on the feasts of Confessors, Virgins,
and Angels, and on Christmas, Epiphany, Candlemas, Maundy
Thursday, and the Ascension; it was used as a matter of course
on all other days where it was not otherwise specified, since until
then white had been the universal liturgical colour. Red vestments
were to be worn on feasts of Apostles and Martyrs. On
feasts of the Holy Cross a choice between white and red was
allowed. Red was to be used on Pentecost in memory of the fiery
tongues, and on the feast of SS. Peter and Paul. On the Conversion
of St Paul and on the feast of St Peter’s Chair, white was to
be used. White was the colour for the Nativity of St John the
Baptist, red for his Beheading. On All Saints many used red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
vestments, but the Roman Church used white, because it is said
in the Apocalypse that the saints stand before the Lamb in white
garments, with palms in their hands.</p>

<p>Black vestments are to be worn on days of penitence and
abstinence, and also on the Commemorations of the dead. They
were also worn during Advent and Lent, except, of course, on
festivals falling within those seasons. With regard to the Holy
Innocents some decided in favour of black, some in favour of red,
but the Roman pontiff decided for violet. For ferias and ordinary
days the colour was green. One might, in addition, wear scarlet
for red, violet for black, and yellow for green.</p>

<p>In Durandus († 1296) we find the same rule, in parts verbally
identical with the above. The only point to notice in regard to
what he says is that he says black vestments are to be worn on
Rogation days, violet seems to have the preference over black for
Advent and Lent, and the use of the former colour is represented
as peculiar to the Roman Church.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p>There is accordingly nothing strange in the circumstance that
in the more ancient rituals, only <i>vestes solleminores</i> in general are
prescribed for Maunday Thursday, without reference to colour.
The Roman use,<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> from the beginning, was to use white on this day,
and this superseded the customs observed elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<span class="smcap">The Word Mass as a Name for the Sacrifice of the Altar</span></h4>

<p>The term mass does not owe its position to theology, but became
established in the course of centuries by popular usage. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
most ancient writers of the church speak frequently, and with all
the precision desirable of the holy sacrifice of the altar, but they
speak of it by other names which fully indicate its essential
character, such as <i>oblatio</i> and <i>sacrificium</i>, or even <i>sacramenta</i> and
<i>collecta</i>. These two last names have a more general significance;
<i>collecta</i> is the late Latin abbreviation for <i>collectio</i>, and means an
assembly of men for some given purpose, in this case for divine
service. <i>Colligere</i> appears in the same sense in the Latin translation
of Irenæus and in Tertullian; the substantive is found in
Jerome and other ancient authors; a survival of this primitive usage
appears in the name <i>collecta</i> given to the first prayer of the Mass.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>
It owes its name of <i>collecta</i> to the fact that according to the most
ancient ritual it formed the commencement of the Mass. In the
service-books, <i>collecta</i> was merely a name which served to distinguish
the prayers of the Mass from those which preceded or followed.
According to the Roman rite, the Mass began with the prayer of
the priest at the altar as soon as the <i>invitatorium</i> sung by the choir
was finished, the psalm <i>Judica me</i>, the <i>Confiteor</i>, the <i>Kyrie</i> and
<i>Gloria</i> being later additions. Thus the name <i>collecta</i> became
attached to this opening prayer, and is so given to it in most
mediæval and Roman missals, until the reform under Pius V.,
when it was replaced by the name <i>oratio</i> now in use. At the
same time the name <i>postcommunio</i> replaced the older title <i>ad
complendum</i>. Whenever we find in prayer-books and explanations
of the Mass, that the prayer was called the Collect because the
priest “collected” the petitions of the faithful, we can only regard
such an interpretation as silly and unhistorical; the same could
be said equally well of all, or, at any rate, of most of the prayers of
the Mass.</p>

<p>The term <i>sacramentum</i> or <i>sacramenta</i> served also not unfrequently
as a name for the Mass,<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> and so gave rise to the name
<i>sacramentarium</i>, generally given to the missal in ancient times. In
addition to these names, <i>oblatio</i> and <i>sacrificio</i> were especially
employed as having the advantage of adequately expressing the
essential character of the rite. The former was the particular
favourite of Tertullian, the founder of Latin ecclesiastical terminology,
and afterwards of St Cyprian, but it may be said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
belong to all writers and to all periods.<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> St Augustine, who had
already propounded a formal theory of the sacrifice of the Mass,
shows a preference for <i>sacrificium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>When we turn to the word <i>missa</i>, we must not treat it as a participle,
even in the <i>Ite missa est</i>, for there is nothing with which the feminine
participle can agree, and so it must be a substantive. In order to explain
the meaning of this substantive, and to show how it acquired
its position as the technical term for the most sacred act of the
Church’s worship, requires an excursus dealing with the matter from
the point of view of etymology, patrology, and liturology. As
regards the etymology of the word, attempts have been made from
time to time to derive <i>missa</i> from the Hebrew, (‎‏מסּה‎‏ Deut., xvi. 10),
in the belief the name must be as old as the thing it signifies, an
attempt abandoned as absurd at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> A better idea
was that of the mediæval liturgists who explained the word as equivalent
to <i>transmissio</i> in the sense of the offering up and presentation
of the oblation before God. But fortunately there is one man,
thoroughly conversant at first hand with primitive usages and
terminology, who has left us an explanation of the word and of
the origin of its application to the sacrifice of the altar. Bishop
Avitus, of Vienne († 518), flourished at the period between the ages
of antiquity and the mediæval period, and is, therefore, a reliable
witness in this matter. He was asked by his sovereign, King
Gundobad of Burgundy, what was the meaning of the word <i>missa</i>,
and replied that <i>missam facere</i> was the same as <i>dimittere</i>, and was
used by the Romans at both audiences in the royal palace and
sittings of the law courts to intimate to the assembly that the
audience or session was at an end and that they were free to
depart; it was used in the same way in the churches. Avitus<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>
himself uses <i>missa</i> simply for divine service.</p>

<p>It is clear that the explanation given by Avitus is correct. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
since the conclusion of every session and assembly must be officially
announced with words such as, “The session is at an end,” so in
church, where a still greater number of men meet together, it is
necessary to make known to them the conclusion of divine service.
Such was the custom of the ancient Romans at their sacrifices and
religious ceremonies, and the Christians naturally did the same.
Tertullian speaks already of a <i>dimissio plebis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> and we find the same
thing in the Greek liturgies, although the formulæ vary in some
respects from that in use among the Latins.<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p>It was not, however, the Mass which was first called by this
name, but the other services of the ancient Church—the Psalmody,
or, in other words, the Canonical Hours. From the striking account
given by the so-called Silvia,<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> we can see how important these
services were and what a prominent position they occupied in the
worship of the Church. “Every day, in the early morning, the
doors of the church were opened, and all the monks and nuns,
as well as many of the laity, assembled, and until sunrise, sing
hymns and psalms, in alternate choirs, along with the antiphons and
prayers. About sunrise they begin to say the ‘<i>matutinas ymnos</i>.’
The bishop arrives with the clergy and sings the prayer within the
chancel. Then he comes forth and blesses the people one by one.
<i>Et sic fit missa</i>,” <i>i.e.</i> so the service ends, which comprised Nocturns,
Lauds, and Prime, as they would now be called. The same ceremonies
were observed at the Little Hours which followed later.
Vespers were performed with more ceremony; at the conclusion
the deacon directed the faithful to bow their heads in order to
receive the bishop’s blessing. Again the pilgrim ends her description
with the words, “<i>Et sic fit missa</i>.”</p>

<p>We must notice that the Psalmody took place daily in this way,
while the Mass, especially in the East, was not celebrated daily;
in Lent, for example, it was celebrated on Saturdays and Sundays
only. At each hour there took place a dismissal, <i>missa</i>, and thus
it was brought about that this word came to be used as a name for
each of the canonical hours. The name was far-fetched and
unsuitable, but popular usage does not form its nomenclature upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
scientific principles, but from what most strikes the popular fancy.
Thus the pilgrim, who expresses herself in popular language,
speaks of <i>missa vigiliarum</i>, for Mattins, and <i>missa lucernaris</i> for
Vespers. The word <i>missa</i> in itself means dismissal and nothing
more. Once, in her naïve manner, she explains what sort of dismissal
she means; it is dismissal out of the church (“<i>missa de
ecclesia</i>,” c. 37, § 3, line 20). Which of the various dismissals out of
the church is intended in a given case is shown by an additional
phrase, as in the cases given above, when it is not clear from the
context. Of course it may mean the dismissal which took place at
the Mass, but not the sacrifice of the Mass itself. How far <i>missa</i>
is from being in the pilgrim’s diary the technical term for Mass—which
is all we are concerned with here—is sufficiently clear from
the circumstance that wherever she lets slip the word <i>missa</i> for
Mass, she at once hastens to add that the <i>missa</i> of which she speaks
is the <i>oblatio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> When she wishes to express herself with precision,
she always calls the Mass <i>oblatio</i>, and in a few cases <i>sacramentum</i>
(singular or plural). Of course <i>missa</i>, as a general term, may have
been used as a name for the Mass, since there are one or more
dismissals therein; had it not been so, <i>missa</i> could never have
become the name <i>par excellence</i> for the Mass.</p>

<p>The same terminology is found at a somewhat later date in
Cassian, to whom we are especially indebted for our intimate
knowledge of monastic observances. An important part of these
observances were the daily hours of prayer, the canonical hours,
and we naturally expect to find the technical terms for them
in Cassian’s writings. And so, indeed, we find the names formed
with the help of the word <i>missa</i>, as in Silvia’s diary; Mattins and
Lauds are called <i>missa nocturna</i> or <i>missa vigiliarum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> while the Mass,
on the other hand, is called <i>oblatio</i> or <i>sacrificium</i>.</p>

<p>From these passages it appears that <i>missa</i> in its strict sense
means “dismissal,” and is a general term capable of receiving a
particular significance by the addition of <i>vigiliarum</i>, etc. The
same thing appears in Pope Innocent I. (<i>Epist.</i> 17, c. 12; <span class="smcap">Migne</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
xx. 535), where he speaks of the priests belonging to the party of
Bonosus, and asks if they have celebrated Mass, which he calls
<i>sacramenta conficere</i>, if they have given Holy Communion (<i>si populis
tribuit</i>), and if they have performed the customary dismissals (<i>si
missas complevit</i>). Apart from the fact that in the same passage
two different terms cannot well stand for the same thing, the use
of the plural shows that it is not the Mass which is meant but the
other <i>missæ</i>, the hours, the performance of which concerned both
the bishop and the priests. There is no doubt as to which term
Leo I. used for the Mass, for <i>oblatio</i> and <i>sacrificium</i> occur several
times in his writings. When in one passage we find the word
<i>missa</i> as well, this can only mean the dismissal, the conclusion of
divine service.<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> Thus even in the fifth century <i>missa</i> by itself
always meant merely dismissal, never Mass; for Mass, the terms
<i>sacrificium</i> and <i>oblatio</i> were employed.</p>

<p>This was the correct use of the terms in question during that
period. But since, as we have said, the ceremonial dismissals
(<i>missæ</i>) at the end of divine service gave rise to the name, and
since dismissals of this kind occurred in the Mass,<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> once at the end
and once after the sermon at the dismissal of the Catechumens, it
is not remarkable that <i>missa</i> came into use as a name for the
Mass, and came to be regarded as its special name in proportion
as the canonical hours became less services for the laity than of
obligation for clergy and religious. There was however an intermediate
period before <i>missa</i> became solely and exclusively the popular
name for the Mass. This transitional state of affairs extended
over the whole of the sixth century, and appears in the writings
of St Benedict and St Gregory the Great, who both employ <i>missa</i>
without distinction as a name for the Mass and for the canonical
hours.<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> The same thing appears in Gregory of Tours and in other
writers. The last appearance of <i>missa</i> as a name for both kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
divine service without distinction appears to be a passage in the
life of St Ludgerus by Altfrid.<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<p>The terminology employed by the official organs of the Church
is naturally of weight in this matter. When the authorities of the
Church made use of a term so little expressive of the nature of the
thing as <i>missa</i>, which had already taken the popular fancy, it was
inevitable that it should become the only recognised name for the
Mass; and this is just what happened. On glancing through the
canons of the ancient Councils of the West, we find all the terms
with which we are already familiar—<i>oblatio</i> by the Council of
Arles in 314 (Canons 5 and 19), and <i>sacrificium</i> by the Councils
of Carthage (that of 390, Canon 8; that of 397, Canon 14),
etc. We also find the term <i>missæ</i> applied to the particular parts
of the Psalmody,<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> and to the other services composed of Psalmody
and Mass together.<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> As a term clearly and unmistakably applied
to the Mass by itself, <i>missa</i> appears for the first time in the fourth
Synod of Arles in 524 (Canon 4), and then in sundry other
Gallic synods of the sixth century.</p>

<p>On the other hand it must be stated once for all that <i>missa</i> in
the sense of Mass is not to be found in the fourth century. The
one solitary instance which for a long time seemed to countenance
such a view is in a letter of St Ambrose,<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> in which he tells his
sister of the attempts made by the Arians on Palm Sunday 385 to
gain possession of the principal church of Milan. Ambrose was
performing divine service, the homily was concluded, and he was
just on the point of dismissing the catechumens, when the
alarming news arrived that the Arians has seized a basilica situated
outside the walls; he did not allow himself to be upset by the
news, but remained where he was, dismissed the catechumens,
and commenced the Mass, during which he received further
information concerning the tumult. The question turns upon the
words, “Ego tamen mansi in munere, missam facere cœpi. Dum
offero,” etc. Hitherto <i>missa</i> has here been always taken in the
sense of Mass, but it has really the sense of dismissal. For on
Palm Sunday in Milan, the so-called <i>traditio symboli</i> to the more
advanced class of catechumens was performed with much ceremony,
something like a first Communion with us; on this day a twofold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
dismissal of the catechumens was necessary, the first of the lower
class of catechumens, because they must not yet learn the creed
which was now to be recited by the more advanced, and then followed
the dismissal of the more advanced catechumens, the <i>competentes</i>,
because these, as being still unbaptised, could not yet assist at the
Mass.</p>

<p>Against this interpretation it has been urged<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> that <i>missa</i> must
mean Mass, because, the act of dismissal being so short, Ambrose
could scarcely have said, “Missam facere cœpi,” had he meant
only the dismissal of the catechumens. How long an act must
continue in order that its beginning, middle, and ending may be
observable depends upon circumstances, but the dismissal of the
<i>competentes</i> was sometimes far from brief. The Apostolic Constitutions,
for instance, give a formula for this act, and the prayers
used cover three printed pages (<i>Constit. Apost.</i>, 8, 5, § 6 to 6, § 4).
At the dismissal of the candidates for baptism, three prayers were
recited (<i>ib.</i> 8, 7, § 2, to c. 7, § 1), one by the deacon, one by the
catechumens, and one by the bishop, who then gave his blessing.
Then followed an address by the bishop, of which we have two
examples, in the 215th and 216th of the sermons of St
Augustine. The act lasted long enough to have a beginning,
middle, and ending.</p>

<p>From what has been said, we conclude, <i>missa</i> appears in the
fourth century as a technical name for the various parts of divine
service, especially for the canonical hours. During the sixth and
seventh centuries it became a technical term for the Mass, and
gradually usurped the place of other names for the Mass. These,
however, survived in isolated instances until the ninth century,
but disappeared entirely in the Middle Ages.</p>

<h4>(p. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>)<br>
<span class="smcap">On the Date for Christmas in Hippolytus</span></h4>

<p>Considering the uncertainty as to the day of our Lord’s birth
shown by Clement of Alexandria, and the reserve which Irenæus
and Tertullian maintain on the same point, it is surprising to find
the most precise data given for its determination by a writer very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
little posterior to those just mentioned. In the commentary of
Hippolytus on Dan. iv. 23 (in Bratke’s ed., 19), we read in the text
discovered in 1885; “The first Advent of our Lord in the flesh,
when He was born in Bethlehem, happened on the eighth day
before the calends of January, on a Wednesday, in the forty-second
year of Augustus, in the year 5500, reckoning from Adam. He
suffered in His thirty-third year, on the eighth day before the
calends of April (25th March), on a Friday, in the eighteenth
year of Tiberius, when Rufus and Rubellius were consuls.”<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>Not merely the astonishing minuteness of the data, but also
the circumstance that this passage is to be found in a shorter form
in a fragment, long well known to scholars, preserved in the Chigi
Library in Rome, coupled with the fact that ancient ecclesiastical
writers quote from it the year of world alone,<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> must give rise to
doubts concerning the longer form of the passage in itself, as well
as concerning the separate data of which it is composed.</p>

<p>If we turn our attention first to these separate data, we find the
names of the consuls wrongly given; their names are Fufius and
Rubellius, not Rufus and Rubellius. Mistakes in the names of
consuls are certainly not rare in Eastern writers, but in the case of a
man like Hippolytus, who lived in Rome, such a mistake is very
astonishing, since he could easily have found out the right names.
Next, according to the authentic Hippolytus, our Lord’s life
lasted only thirty-one years, and not thirty-three; this appears
from the passage in the so-called <i>Liber Generationis</i> representing
in a Latin translation part of the “Chronicle” which,
according to the inscription on his statue, Hippolytus had composed.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
Again, the eighteenth year of Tiberius is also wrong.
The forty-second year of Augustus and the two week-days may be
correct (see <i>Comm. Dan.</i>, 4, 9; in Bratke 8), for the latter appear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
also in the same connection in the inscription on the statue.
Wednesday found acceptance as the day of Christ’s birth owing to
the Messias being called in Malachy iv. 2, “the Sun of Justice,”
from which it was inferred that He must have been born on the
same day of the week as that on which the visible sun had been
created (Gen. i. 19).</p>

<p>But, moreover, the days of the week have been interpolated into
the text, since they do not fit in with the sequence of thought but
rather disturb it. The aim of Hippolytus was here to calm the
Christians agitated by the persecution of Severus; many went so
far as to think that the last day was close at hand, and Hippolytus
opposed himself to this alarm by declaring God had created the
world in six days, with God a thousand years are as one day (Ps.
lxxxix. 4), and thus the world would last six thousand years. Until
the birth of Christ only five thousand five hundred years had
passed, and so the end of the world was not to be expected yet.
In such a train of thought, what place is there for days of the week
and consulates? The late origin of the passage is also betrayed
by the parallel grouping of the data given, for elaborate attempts of
this kind were popular in the Middle Ages, but not in primitive
times. Accordingly only the year 5500 of the world, and perhaps
also the forty-second year of Augustus, belong to the original form
of the passage in Hippolytus, all the rest having being added by
a later hand.<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a></p>

<span class="smcap">Christmas in England during the Commonwealth</span></h4>

<p>Christmas was abolished in England in the seventeenth century
during the reign of the Puritans, and its prohibition was strictly
enforced. In 1644, after the overthrow of the monarchy, when the
Puritans came into power, an Act of Parliament forbade all
observance of Christmas, for it was held that Christmas was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
originally a Christian festival at all, but was of heathen origin.
Parliament directed that the 25th December, “which had hitherto
been commonly called Christmas Day,” was to be kept as a fast.
This law remained in force for sixteen years, and during this
period the enactment was repeated and made still more stringent.
No church dare be opened, no service of any kind held; the law
expressly enacted that on Christmas Day everyone was to go on
as usual with his work, and every merchant who shut his shop on
this day was brought before the judge and punished. Markets
were held on this day which had hitherto been held on other days,
merely to make it impossible to keep the day as a festival.
Plum-pudding and mince pies were branded as heathenish
inventions. The soldiers were charged to break into houses in
order to see that no one had food in his home such as used to be
eaten at Christmas and when anything of this kind was discovered,
the soldiers were to seize it and the people were punished into
the bargain. There were naturally some who refused to abstain
from the celebration of Christmas in obedience to these directions
of the Parliament; many ministers performed service in their
churches and several of them were taken before the judge and
punished. In different places disturbances broke out, especially
owing to the orders of Parliament that markets were to be held
on Christmas Day while they were forbidden on other days of the
week. In Canterbury, for instance, there was a general riot; the
whole town was divided into two parties—those who observed
Christmas and their opponents, and the festival of peace ended in
a general row; many houses of the town were totally destroyed
and some set on fire. Charles II. made it his aim to revoke as
quickly as possible the laws passed during the Commonwealth,
and so before long Christmas was once more observed as before.
The Nonconformists, however, long held by their determination
not to celebrate Christmas, and they kept a sharp look-out that at
least their ministers should eat no Christmas pudding or mince
pies; they called Yuletide Fooltide. In Scotland, Christmas is
still regarded as something heathenish; the Presbyterians will
have nothing whatever to do with its celebration, and throughout
the country no special notice is of it as a religious feast. [This,
of course, only refers to the Protestants of Scotland. Trans.]</p>

<span class="smcap">Excursus on the Three Holy Kings</span></h4>

<p>Epiphany is a feast of our Lord and not the feast of the Three
Holy Kings, although it is popularly called so, and, in the liturgy
for the day, they are referred to. In a small number of dioceses,
and only at a late date, they have been the object of a cultus, but
in the calendars and menologies of the principal Churches they
find no place; ancient ecclesiastical literature and tradition has
also nothing to relate of them. Only in the twelfth century did
they emerge from oblivion when the imperial chancellor, Rainald
von Dassel, afterwards Archbishop of Cologne, translated their
reputed relics to Cologne, 23rd July 1164, having received them
as a gift from Frederick Barbarossa after the destruction of Milan.
Until this time they had rested in the little Church of St
Eustorgius at Milan, to which they are said to have been brought
from Constantinople. The life of St Eustorgius, Bishop of Milan,
315-331, relates how this happened:—there lived in Constantinople
a pious man called Eustorgius, a Greek by birth, and a
favourite and adviser of the emperor. (The name of the emperor
is passed over in silence by the author.) He sent Eustorgius as
ambassador—the purpose of the embassy is not disclosed—to the
province of Liguria, of which the capital is called Milan—which,
however, is a mistake. Eustorgius won the affections of the
Milanese to such a degree that they desired to have him as their
bishop; after long resistance he consented, and went to the
emperor in order to obtain his approval. The emperor rejoiced
over the love which his ambassador had inspired, as Gratian had
rejoiced over the appointment of St Ambrose, ratified the
election, and forthwith remitted all taxes to the Milanese (!).
Eustorgius was unwilling to return empty-handed and begged for
some relics from the emperor with which to enrich his bishopric.
The emperor allowed him to take whatever he liked, and he chose
the relics of the Three Holy Kings, which had been sent from the
East by Helena. A church was now built in Milan in which the
relics were laid, where they attracted a great concourse of pilgrims
and devotees.</p>

<p>The author regrets that he is not in a position to give us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
further information concerning the doings of Bishop Eustorgius,
but he merely tells us that he died on the 18th October and was
succeeded by Dionysius. This is incorrect for Protasius came
first. The author of this document must have lived in Milan, for he
gives some correct dates in the ecclesiastical history of Milan;
nevertheless, gross blunders against historical truth and other
indications show that we are dealing with a thoroughgoing
fabrication of the eleventh century based upon events in the life of
St Ambrose. The names Gaspar, Melchior, Baltassar make their
first appearance here. A still more naïve account is given in a
sermon belonging to the end of the twelfth century, Eustorgius
being made a contemporary of the Emperor Comnenus; this is
printed in Floss.</p>

<p>Contemporaries who had the opportunity of seeing the relics,
state that the remains were embalmed and incorrupt; to judge
from the face and hair, one of the bodies was that of a boy of
about fifteen years; they were in an excellent state of preservation
considering their age. The story of their translation to Milan
is obviously a romance and the search for their bodies by Helena
is formed upon the recognised model according to which Helena
steps in to effect what cannot be otherwise explained. And so
there is no doubt that we are face to face with a remarkably
successful fabrication, such as were, unfortunately, by no means
rare in the Middle Ages. In Cologne, the Three Holy Kings—all
three of them—were at once set down as martyrs, although it is
difficult to see how they would have suffered, granting them to
have been kings. The Carmelite John of Hildesheim composed a
popular <i>Vita Trium Regum</i>, composed in a simple style, which was
widely read. See <span class="smcap">Usener</span>, ii. 7-10, and the instructive treatise of
H. J. Floss, “Dreikönigenbuch,” Cologne, 1864. The <i>Vita
Eustorgii</i> is only to be found in Mombritius, <i>Sanctuarium</i>, i. 166.</p>

<p>Κυριακὴ ἀπόκρεως,<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> corresponds with Septuagesima Sunday of the
Latins, and is called Abstinence Sunday because with it Lent
with its abstinence from flesh-meat commences. The week
following is called Butter-Week by the Russians, because
the use of <i>lacticinia</i> is still permitted. The Gospel, St
Matthew xxv. 31-46, refers to Christ’s return at the last
judgment. On this account, the Sunday is also called
κυριακὴ τῆς παρουσίας.</p>

<p>Κυριακὴ τῆς τυροφάγου. Sunday of Cheese-Eating, because from
henceforth the use of <i>lacticinia</i> is also forbidden (Sexagesima
of the Latins).</p>

The Sunday before Epiphany. Among the Latins a <i>dominica

</div>

<p>The remaining four Sundays of the Greek ecclesiastical year
serve to fill up the inequality due to Easter falling earlier or later,
in the same manner as in the Latin rite. One, two, or all four of
them, as occasion requires, are inserted after Epiphany. They are
the Sundays (1) κυριακὴ μετὰ τὰ φῶτα, the first after Epiphany,
which is pressed into use when Easter falls in March; (2) the
twelfth Sunday after St Luke; (3) the fifteenth after St Luke
(the two Sundays in the Christmas season are reckoned as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
thirteenth and fourteenth after St Luke since their gospels are
taken from that evangelist); (4) the seventeenth Sunday after St
Matthew. All four are required when Easter falls on the 22-25
April. In this way the gaps between the end of the old ecclesiastical
year and the beginning of the new are filled up.</p>

<p>As far as the immovable feasts are concerned, the Greeks
divide all feasts, both movable and immovable, into four classes.
The first and highest class contains: Christmas, Epiphany (6th
January), Candlemas (2nd February, ὑπαπάντη τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν), the
Annunciation (ὁ εύαγγελισμός), Easter, Palm Sunday, the Ascension,
Pentecost, the Transfiguration, the Assumption (ἡ κοίμησις,
15th August), our Lady’s Nativity (8th September), the Exaltation
of the Holy Cross (14th September), and the <i>Presentatio
B.M.V.</i> (21st November).</p>

<p>Somewhat lower in rank are the <i>Circumcisio</i>, <i>Nativitas S.
Joannis Bapt.</i> (24th June), SS. Peter and Paul (29th June), and
the <i>Decollatio S. Joannis Bapt.</i> (29th August). It is not necessary
here to enumerate the remaining feasts.</p>

<h4>(p. <a href="#Page_248">248</a>)<br>
<span class="smcap">English Writers and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception</span></h4>

<p>The well known Doctor of the Church, Anselm, was born of a
German stock, as his name implies, at Aosta in 1036. In 1053 he
entered the Benedictine order at Bec in Normandy where
Lanfranc was at that time abbot. In 1078 he was himself elected
abbot of the monastery, and in this capacity was brought into
relation with William the Conqueror and William Rufus. During
an illness of the latter, he was chosen Archbishop of Canterbury
at the end of 1093 and his appointment was confirmed by the
king. Serious misunderstandings soon arose between them on
the questions of investiture and Church property, and Anselm was
obliged to go to Rome, where he remained until the king’s death.
Further misunderstandings, moreover, soon arose between him and
William’s successor, Henry I., which detained him in France, until
an agreement was arrived at in 1106, by which he was enabled to
return to England and to his bishopric. He died there on the
21st April 1109.</p>

<p>His nephew, Anselm the younger, came from Lombardy, and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
a youth had entered the monastery of St Michael at Chiusa, and
received his theological training from the Benedictines of Canterbury.<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>
After his uncle’s death, he was for a short time abbot of
St Saba in Rome. In 1115 he was chosen by the pope to bring
the pallium to the newly elected Archbishop of Canterbury, Radulf.
As legate, he strongly maintained the rights of the pope in the
election of bishops, and consequently fell under King Henry’s
displeasure, and had to retire to France until a reconciliation had
been effected between the King and Pope Calixtus II. He was
then elected abbot of Bury St Edmond’s and confirmed as such in
1121. Here he remained until his death on the 11th January
1148. The attempt of a section of the chapter of St Paul’s in
1136 to make him bishop led to no result, but rather caused him
much annoyance.</p>

<p>The Anglo-saxon, Eadmer or Edmer, was a disciple and faithful
attendant of the older Anselm. Born in Kent, he entered the
monastery at Canterbury and accompanied Anselm in his banishment
to Rome. After Anselm’s death, he lived in retirement
from which he emerged for a short time in 1120 to be Bishop of
St Andrews in Scotland. But after a year he resigned and
returned to his monastery, where he died after 1124. He wrote
a history of England, a number of lives of English saints, and
some theological treatises, two of which were in praise of the
Mother of God (<i>De Excellentia Virg. Mariæ</i> and <i>De Quatuor
Virtutibus Mariæ</i>). It has been recently conclusively proved that
he is also the author of a treatise on our Lady’s conception (<i>De
Conceptione S. Mariæ</i>), hitherto generally attributed to one or
other of the two Anselms.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> In his work on the Excellences of
our Lady, in which her share in the work and sufferings of Christ
is brought into prominence, Eadmer adopts a neutral position with
regard to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, and admits
the possibility that she was purified from original sin only at the
Annunciation. In the last-named composition, however, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
advocates the introduction of the festival, he endeavours to
establish the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, and defends
it warmly, and not unskilfully, against many objections, having,
as he says, upon more mature consideration of the matter, recognised
its correctness. The circumstance that this is the first
treatise which aims especially and avowedly at defending this
opinion, endows it with a special interest.</p>

<h4>(pp. <a href="#Page_243">243</a>, <a href="#Page_347">347</a>)<br>
<span class="smcap">Excursus on the so-called Typica</span></h4>

<p>The term <i>Typicum</i> is used first of all by Greek liturgists and
rubricists to denote those short parts of the liturgy which are
composed of verses from the psalms in connection both with the
Canonical Hours and with the Mass, there is nothing exactly
corresponding in the Western rite. (Leo Allatius, <i>De Libris Eccl.
Græc.</i>, 14, 15. Daniel, <i>Thes. Lit.</i>, iv. 313, 319). <i>Typicum</i> is also
used as a technical term, in the Eastern Church especially during
the Byzantine period, in the sense of statute, regulation, etc. It
was applied chiefly to two kinds of documents. First, it designated
the catalogues of the possessions of ecclesiastical establishments
and corporations, especially in so far as they were based upon
testamentary donations, along with the duties entailed by them
upon the clergy. <i>Typica</i> of this kind were called (κτητορικά), and
correspond to the chartularies and “traditiones” of Western
monasteries and bishoprics. Secondly, <i>typicum</i> was a term of a
liturgical character, and as such must be considered here. <i>Typica</i>,
in this sense, were the lists of the feasts recurring in the course
of the year, of liturgical observances, fasts, etc., such as were to
be observed in one of the larger churches or monasteries, along
with detailed descriptions of each; they correspond to the
<i>consuetudines</i> of Western monasteries and cathedrals.</p>

<p><i>Typica</i> of this last kind exist in large numbers, although only a
few of them have been published, and these not in editions useful
for critical purposes. The best known and most important are:
(1) the <i>Typicum S. Sabæ</i>; (2) that belonging to the monastery of the
Studium at Constantinople; and (3) that formerly belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
famous Monastery of St Auxentius in Bithynia, now Ka-ish-dagh,
dating from the time of Michael Paleologus († 1268).</p>

<p>The <i>typicum</i> of St Sabas is sometimes valuable as a source of
liturgical information, and for its references to the festivals of the
Church, but it is only to be used with the greatest caution. It
derives its name not so much from St Sabas himself as from the
monastery called after him near Jerusalem. Leo Allatius gives
the following account of its origin from a dialogue of Simeon of
Thessalonica; St Sabas drew up an order for the canonical hours
and divine service to be observed in his monastery; this “<i>diatyposis</i>”
was destroyed owing to the ravages of the Saracens, but was re-established
by the patriarch Sophronius from memory, and retouched
by St John Damascene; later on it was altered yet
again to meet the requirements of the time. In the sixteenth
century it was printed for practical purposes, as, for example, in
Venice in 1545. In this form the <i>typicum</i> contains the order for
divine service throughout the year for monasteries following the
rule of St Sabas, rubricks for the canonical hours, the fasts and
festivals, with information as to the liturgy to be used, the
gospels and epistles, the menology, instructions on the canonical
hours, etc., also rules of life and statutes for the monks and
selected passages from the Greek Fathers. It received its present
form apparently from John <i>Grammaticus</i> in Constantinople in the
twelfth century, and cannot, of course, be regarded as a work of
St Sabas. This cannot be appealed to for evidence concerning
ecclesiastical customs in use before the twelfth century.</p>

<p>In the Eastern Church <i>typica</i> are issued from time to time,
somewhat corresponding to our directories.</p>

Easter being fixed on a stated Sunday in April. According to information
given in the <i>Kölnischen Volkszeitung</i> for the 22nd May 1894, the
Barnabite Cæsar Tondini is said to be at work upon a reform of the
Calendar, the chief features of which are the giving a fixed date for
Easter and the transferring of the extra day in leap year to the end of
the year. He is of opinion that this reform will be acceptable to the
Russians also.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_110" href="#FNanchor_110" class="label">[110]</a> Among the Fathers, St Ambrose, more especially, deals with the
question of the day of the week and day of the month on which the Last
Supper took place. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Epist.</i> 23, written in 386. He says the Last
Supper was held on the 14th Nisan which was a Thursday, on the 15th,
Christ was crucified, and, on the 17th, He rose again. The day of His
death must be kept in sorrow and fasting. Therefore the two events
cannot be commemorated on the same day, and Christ’s death cannot be
commemorated on a Sunday. If the 15th Nisan falls on a Sunday,
Easter must be postponed to the following week. When Johannes
Philoponus, in the treatise <i>De Paschate</i> (ed. C. Walter, Leipzig, 1899)
makes our Lord keep the Last Supper on the 13th Nisan and celebrate

(St Mark xxvi. 17) means τῇ πρώτῃ πρὸ τῶν ἀζύμων.</p>

draws attention: “Miramur satis, quod visum fuerit hoc tempore quibusdam
monasteriis mutare colorem optimum novas quasdam inducendo
celebritates.... Quæ igitur ratio hæc festa celebrandi nobis induxcit,
festum videlicet s. trinitatis et festum transfigurationis Domini? Additur

S. Mariæ” (<i>De Statu Domus Dei lib.</i>; <span class="smcap">De la Bigne</span>, <i>Magna Bibl. Vet.
Patrum</i>, ix. 588). One must make allowances for Potho’s standpoint. He
set himself energetically against the monks having the cure of souls or
any say in the administration of the Church, as detrimental to their
vocation to the contemplative life. On the same grounds, he set himself
against all alterations in the rule, and all innovations in the festivals of
the Church’s year.</p>

delivered his address on the 6th Jan. 353, and so is of opinion that
Christmas was celebrated for the first time in Rome on the 25th Dec. 353.
On the other hand, <span class="smcap">Duchesne</span> (<i>Bull. Crit.</i>, 1890, No. 3, p. 41 <i>seq.</i>),
having the circumstance in view that the Depositio Episcoporum begins
the year with the 27th Dec. and the Depositio Martyrum with the 25th
Dec., thinks he has proof for holding that the 27th Dec. for a long time
already, indeed even from about 243, had been a marked day in the
Church’s Calendar, and, accordingly, that the 25th Dec. had been kept as
the Natalis Domini as early as the third century. We leave these points
to the reader’s discretion. Christmas was kept in Rome certainly before
353.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_446" href="#FNanchor_446" class="label">[446]</a> Remigius, a monk of St Germain, a diligent exegete who lived at
the end of the ninth century, attempted to give an allegorical interpretation
to the rites observed at the consecration of a church. The
custom of writing the letters of the alphabet in Greek and Latin on the
floor of the church seems to have presented difficulties to him. He commences
his explanation of this rite by the words: “Quæ res puerilis
ludus videretur, nisi ab apostolius viris instituta crederetur.” He interprets
it as meaning that the Church instructs the unlearned in the elements
of faith. His tractate in seven chapters is in <span class="smcap">Migne</span>, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>,

<p><a id="Footnote_529" href="#FNanchor_529" class="label">[529]</a> [The feast was, however, observed in England before the Norman
Conquest. The evidence for this is given by Mr Edmund Bishop in his
tract, <i>On the Origins of the Feast of the Conception of the Bl. V. M.</i>, London,
Burns &amp; Oates, 1904. From this the following is taken: (1) Calendar
contained in Cotton MS. Titus D., xxvii., has the entry in the original
hand at 8th Dec: “Conceptio sancte Dei genitricis Mariæ.” This MS.
was written in the New Minster, Winchester, under Abbot Aelfwin
(1034-57). (2) Calendar of the Old Minster, Winchester (Cotton MS.,
Vitellius E., xviii.), has the same entry. The MS. is attributed by Hicks
to or about 1030. (3) Add. MS., 28, 188, a pontifical and benedictional of
the eleventh century probably written for Bp. Leofric (1046-72), and
“distinctly pre-Norman.” In this, fol. 161, is a “Benedictio in Conceptione
Sancte Mariæ.” (4) Harl. MS. 2892, also a pontifical and benedictional
written for Canterbury in the first half of the eleventh century (to

Leofric Missal, among the Masses added to the book by Bp. Leofric, is a
Mass for the feast of the Conception (p. 268); II. In a Worcester Calendar
of about 1064, and written therefore under St Wulstan and before the
conquest, the feast of the Conception is entered at 8th Dec. Trans.]</p>

Walter had withheld certain endowments which his predecessor Rotricus
appointed for the metropolitan chapter on certain festivals. These he
now restored. Vacandard (<i>Les origines de la Fête d. C. Imm.</i>: Révue des
Questions Hist., 1897, 166) was unacquainted with this decree, else he
would have arrived at a different conclusion. Moreover he himself brings
forward proof that the feast was celebrated during the twelfth century in
Jumièges and St Owen, but not until the thirteenth century at Fécamp.</p>

7-9. On the 5th August takes place the local feast of Our Lady of the
Snows, “Maria ad Nives,” in the basilica of Sta. Maria Maggiore in
Rome. As the office has been incorporated in the Breviary, a short
account of it may be justified in this place. Pope Liberius erected a
basilica on the Esquiline, on the site of Livia’s market, which was called
after him “Liberiana.” In the next century, Sixtus III. restored the
church and changed its title, dedicating it to the Mother of God (<i>Lib.
Pont.</i>, Liberius, No. 52, Xystus III., No. 63). From henceforth it was
known as “Basilica S. Mariæ,” at the present day, Sta. Maria Maggiore.
The miracle of the snow is not mentioned in any of the original
documents, but only in mediæval writings. The 5th August may have
been the day of the dedication of the basilica. See <span class="smcap">Grisar</span>, <i>Gesch. Roms.</i>, i.
153 A. 1. The legend of the translation of the Holy House of Loreto
(10th Dec.) will not stand historical investigation. According to trustworthy
accounts, pilgrims to Nazareth already in the eighth century found
the holy house there no longer, but only a church on the site where it
had stood. <span class="smcap">Adamnan</span>, <i>De Locis Sanctis</i>, 2, 26; <span class="smcap">Migne</span>, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>,

1905, 258 <i>seqq.</i> Fr. Hippolyte Delahaye, in the <i>Analecta Bollandiana</i>
(xxii. 1903, 86 <i>seq.</i>), when reviewing my articles, characterised my statements
as “trop ingenieuses” and “fragiles,” without, however, being able
to adduce any arguments on the other side. My first opponent, Dr Kirsch,
was at least sufficiently fortunate as to ferret out a misprint. The sole
attempt to overthrow my conclusions reduces itself to the remark that
the “Depositio Martyrum” is not an exhaustive catalogue of all the
Roman martyrs who had suffered previously to its compilation. I never
said it was. But did it not contain all the <i>martyres recogniti</i> in Rome at the
commencement of the fourth century (<i>cf.</i> below, page 350, for Mommsen’s
remarks on this point), it would be a worthless piece of paper from which
nothing could be gathered. Fr. Delahaye seems not to understand that,
in dealing with material of this kind, it is of the utmost importance to
start with what is actually known of the Roman officials and governments
of the period. When he scornfully criticises my work as “trop ingenieux,”
I must say that on my part I have found nothing in his obscure ex
cathedra assertions to upset the date given above to the martyrdom of
St Cecilia. [See <span class="smcap">Lightfoot</span>, <i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, pt. ii. vol. i. 516-522,

<p><a id="Footnote_784" href="#FNanchor_784" class="label">[784]</a> If this be the case, and it is not free from doubt, still the name of
Arius was not read out “at the altar,” as <span class="smcap">Achelis</span> states (87 and 98), for
the martyrologies were not read at the altar but in the choir, and it would
have happened only were the Weissenburg Codex in use, for other codices
have different readings. The reading of the martyrology—not of the
“Passions” of the martyrs—at the choir office dates back, as far as the
evidence exists, to the ninth century. Bishop Gregorius of Corduba, whom
<span class="smcap">Achelis</span> (98, note 4) places at a very early period, is not an historical
personage; he exists only in the list of bishops contained in the letters
ascribed to St Jerome.</p>

that white was not the only liturgical colour in antiquity, and rests
his contention on some representation (not miniatures) of the fifth to the

“white” is not to be taken as meaning always “snow-white,” and the
natural colour of silk and wool would border on yellow. The representations
may have grown darker through age, or been painted over at
a later date. At any rate the proofs on which he relies are not sufficiently

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
